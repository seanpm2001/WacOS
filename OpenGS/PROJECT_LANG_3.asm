; For: WacOS/OpenGS/OS
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the third project language for this project (WacOS/OpenGS/OS) because Assembly is the best language for hardware interactions, alongside C, and is one of the top languages used on this project. It comes after C and Pascal, due to lesser usage. Also, the systems this project is based on are mainly written in this language. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
