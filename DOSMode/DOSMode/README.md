# WacOS

## DOS Mode master repository

This is the master repository for WacOS DOS Mode. It contains the data for both 4 bit and 8 bit DOS mode versions. The project is written in Assembly, but is not functional yet.

## Home repositories

### 4 bit

These are the mainhouse and guesthouse links for the 4 bit version.

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_4-Bit_DOSMode/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.

[Home repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/WacOS-dev/DOSMode/4Bit/)

This is the home repository. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.

### 8 bit
