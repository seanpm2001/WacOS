; Project language file 1
; For: WacOS/8-Bit_DOSMode
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the first project language for this project (WacOS/8-Bit-DOSMode) because Assembly is a very low level language that can access the required sections of memory needed for this project. Since this is being based on a project with an extremely light operating system, Assembly may be the only language used. Pascal for sure won't be used, but there is a chance I might include C in the future if needed. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
