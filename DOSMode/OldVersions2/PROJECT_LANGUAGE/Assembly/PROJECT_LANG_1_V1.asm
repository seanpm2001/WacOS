; Project language file 1
; For: WacOS/DOSMode
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the first project language for this project (WacOS/DOSMode) because Assembly is a very low level language that can access the required sections of memory needed for this project. Since this is being based on a project with an extremely light operating system, Assembly may be the only language used. Pascal for sure won't be used, but there is a chance I might include C in the future if needed. Assembly was also the first language of the 2 original subprojects to this project (4-Bit_DOSMode & 8-Bit_DOSMode) It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
