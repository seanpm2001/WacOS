/// A type that provides subscript access to its elements.
///
/// In most cases, it's best to ignore this protocol and use the
/// `MutableCollection` protocol instead, because it has a more complete
/// interface.
@available(*, deprecated, message: "it will be removed in Swift 4.0.  Please use 'MutableCollection' instead")
public typealias MutableIndexable = MutableCollection

/// A collection that supports subscript assignment.
///
/// Collections that conform to `MutableCollection` gain the ability to
/// change the value of their elements. This example shows how you can
/// modify one of the names in an array of students.
///
///     var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime"]
///     if let i = students.index(of: "Maxime") {
///         students[i] = "Max"
///     }
///     print(students)
///     // Prints "["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Max"]"
///
/// In addition to changing the value of an individual element, you can also
/// change the values of a slice of elements in a mutable collection. For
/// example, you can sort *part* of a mutable collection by calling the
/// mutable `sort()` method on a subscripted subsequence. Here's an
/// example that sorts the first half of an array of integers:
///
///     var numbers = [15, 40, 10, 30, 60, 25, 5, 100]
///     numbers[0..<4].sort()
///     print(numbers)
///     // Prints "[10, 15, 30, 40, 60, 25, 5, 100]"
///
/// The `MutableCollection` protocol allows changing the values of a
/// collection's elements but not the length of the collection itself. For
/// operations that require adding or removing elements, see the
/// `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocol instead.
///
/// Conforming to the MutableCollection Protocol
/// ============================================
///
/// To add conformance to the `MutableCollection` protocol to your own
/// custom collection, upgrade your type's subscript to support both read
/// and write access.
/// 
/// A value stored into a subscript of a `MutableCollection` instance must
/// subsequently be accessible at that same position. That is, for a mutable
/// collection instance `a`, index `i`, and value `x`, the two sets of
/// assignments in the following code sample must be equivalent:
///
///     a[i] = x
///     let y = a[i]
///     
///     // Must be equivalent to:
///     a[i] = x
///     let y = x
