///   not contain strong or weak references or other forms of indirection are
///   trivial, as are imported C structs and enums. Copying memory that
///   contains values of nontrivial types can only be done safely with a typed

/// ${Self} Semantics
/// =================
///
/// An `${Self}` instance is a view into memory and does not own the memory
/// that it references. Copying a variable or constant of type `${Self}` does
/// not copy the underlying memory. However, initializing another collection
/// with an `${Self}` instance copies bytes out of the referenced memory and
/// into the new collection.
///
/// The following example uses `someBytes`, an `${Self}` instance, to
/// demonstrate the difference between assigning a buffer pointer and using a
/// buffer pointer as the source for another collection's elements. Here, the
/// assignment to `destBytes` creates a new, nonowning buffer pointer
/// covering the first `n` bytes of the memory that `someBytes`
/// references---nothing is copied:
///
///     var destBytes = someBytes[0..<n]
///
/// Next, the bytes referenced by `destBytes` are copied into `byteArray`, a
/// new `[UInt]` array, and then the remainder of `someBytes` is appended to
/// `byteArray`:
///
///     var byteArray: [UInt8] = Array(destBytes)
///     byteArray += someBytes[n..<someBytes.count]
