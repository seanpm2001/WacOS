/// A collection that supports efficient random-access index traversal.
///
/// Random-access collections can move indices any distance and 
/// measure the distance between indices in O(1) time. Therefore, the
/// fundamental difference between random-access and bidirectional collections
/// is that operations that depend on index movement or distance measurement
/// offer significantly improved efficiency. For example, a random-access
/// collection's `count` property is calculated in O(1) instead of requiring
/// iteration of an entire collection.
///
/// Conforming to the RandomAccessCollection Protocol
/// =================================================
///
/// The `RandomAccessCollection` protocol adds further constraints on the
/// associated `Indices` and `SubSequence` types, but otherwise imposes no
/// additional requirements over the `BidirectionalCollection` protocol.
/// However, in order to meet the complexity guarantees of a random-access
/// collection, either the index for your custom type must conform to the
/// `Strideable` protocol or you must implement the `index(_:offsetBy:)` and
/// `distance(from:to:)` methods with O(1) efficiency.
