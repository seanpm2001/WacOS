# Build Android Toolchain

This toolchain will generate the .so and .swiftmodule files of the Swift standard library and Foundation framework for the Android environment, armv7 architecture. Those files are needed when building any Swift library to be included in an application for Android.

To build the toolchain run:

```
android$ ./build-toolchain
```

It will be built on:

```
path/to/swift-source/swift-android-toolchain
```
