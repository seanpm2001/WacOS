/// Describes a specific witness to a (non-type) requirement.
///
/// A witness to a requirement is a specific definition that is used to satisfy
/// that requirement within a particular protocol conformance. For example:
///
/// \code
/// protocol P {
///   func f()
/// }
///
/// struct X : P {
///   func f() { }
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// Here, the function `X.f()` is the witness for the requirement `P.f()`.
///
/// The relationship between a requirement and its witness is more detailed
/// than the declaration of the witness, particularly when the requirement
/// is itself generic. Consider this more-involved example:
///
/// \code
/// protocol P {
///   associatedtype A
/// }
///
/// protocol Q : P { }
///
/// protocol R {
///   associatedtype B
///   func foo<T : Q>(x: T) where T.A == B
/// }
///
/// struct X<U, V> : R {
///   typealias B = U
///
///   func foo<W: P>(x: W) where W.A == U { }
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// The witness for \c R.foo(x:) is \c X<U, V>.foo(x:), but the generic
/// functions that describe the generic requirement in \c R and the generic
/// method in \c X have very different signatures. To handle this case, the
/// \c Witness class produces a "synthetic" environment that pulls together
/// all of the information needed to map from the requirement to the witness.
/// It is a generic environment that combines the constraints of the
/// requirement with the constraints from the context of the protocol
/// conformance itself, which is the environment needed to build the witness
/// "thunk" in SILGen. Specifically, the outer generic parameters of the
/// environment are those of the context of the protocol conformance (\c U
/// and \c V, in the example above) and the innermost generic parameters are
/// those of the generic requirement (\c T, in the example above). The
/// \c Witness class contains this synthetic environment (both its generic
/// signature and a generic environment providing archetypes), a substitution
/// map that allows one to map the interface types of the requirement into
/// the interface types of the synthetic domain, and the set of substitutions
/// required to use the witness from the synthetic domain (e.g., how one would
/// call the witness from the witness thunk).
