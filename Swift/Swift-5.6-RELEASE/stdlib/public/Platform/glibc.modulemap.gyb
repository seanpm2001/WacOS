/// This is a semi-complete modulemap that maps glibc's headers in a roughly
/// similar way to the Darwin SDK modulemap. We do not take care to list every
/// single header which may be included by a particular submodule, so there can
/// still be issues if imported into the same context as one in which someone
/// included those headers directly.
///
/// It's not named just Glibc so that it doesn't conflict in the event of a
/// future official glibc modulemap.
