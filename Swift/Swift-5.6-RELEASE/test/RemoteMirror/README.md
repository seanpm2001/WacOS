Remote Mirror Tests
===================

This directory contains tests for the remote mirror code.  Note in particular
that the interop test that runs from here only tests the version of Swift that
we are currently building.  There is a script in the Inputs folder,
"interop.py", that can be used to test multiple versions together.
