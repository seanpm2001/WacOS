/// By default, Swift's integer and pointer types are usable as the bounds of

///
/// Because floating-point types such as `Float` and `Double` are their own
/// `Stride` types, they cannot be used as the bounds of a countable range. If
/// you need to test whether values are contained within an interval bound by
/// floating-point values, see the `Range` type. If you need to iterate over
/// consecutive floating-point values, see the `stride(from:to:by:)` function.
///
/// Integer Index Ambiguity
/// -----------------------
///
/// Because each element of a `CountableRange` instance is its own index, for
/// the range `(-99..<100)` the element at index `0` is `0`. This is an
/// unexpected result for those accustomed to zero-based collection indices,
/// who might expect the result to be `-99`. To prevent this confusion, in a
/// context where `Bound` is known to be an integer type, subscripting
/// directly is a compile-time error:
///
///     // error: ambiguous use of 'subscript'
///     print((-99..<100)[0])
///
/// However, subscripting that range still works in a generic context:
///
///     func brackets<T>(_ x: CountableRange<T>, _ i: T) -> T {
///         return x[i] // Just forward to subscript
///     }
///     print(brackets(-99..<100, 0))
