  ///
  /// When you need a range that includes the last element of a collection, use
  /// the half-open range operator (`..<`) with `endIndex`. The `..<` operator
  /// creates a range that doesn't include the upper bound, so it's always

  ///     let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

///
/// By default, any custom collection type you create will inherit a

/// collection type, add the minimal requirements of the `Collection`
/// protocol: starting and ending indices and a subscript for accessing
/// elements. With those elements defined, the inherited `makeIterator()`
/// method satisfies the requirements of the `Sequence` protocol.
///
/// Here's an example of a type that declares the minimal requirements for a

/// Collections are used extensively throughout the standard library. When you
/// use arrays, dictionaries, views of a string's contents and other types,
/// you benefit from the operations that the `Collection` protocol declares
/// and implements.
///
/// In addition to the methods that collections inherit from the `Sequence`
/// protocol, you gain access to methods that depend on accessing an element
/// at a specific position when using a collection.
///
/// For example, if you want to print only the first word in a string, search
/// for the index of the first space and then create a subsequence up to that
/// position.
///
///     let text = "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo."
///     if let firstSpace = text.characters.index(of: " ") {
///         print(String(text.characters.prefix(upTo: firstSpace)))
///     }
///     // Prints "Buffalo"
///
/// The `firstSpace` constant is an index into the `text.characters`
/// collection. `firstSpace` is the position of the first space in the
/// collection. You can store indices in variables, and pass them to
/// collection algorithms or use them later to access the corresponding
/// element. In the example above, `firstSpace` is used to extract the prefix
/// that contains elements up to that index.
///
/// You can pass only valid indices to collection operations. You can find a
/// complete set of a collection's valid indices by starting with the
/// collection's `startIndex` property and finding every successor up to, and
/// including, the `endIndex` property. All other values of the `Index` type,
/// such as the `startIndex` property of a different collection, are invalid
/// indices for this collection.
///
/// Saved indices may become invalid as a result of mutating operations; for
/// more information about index invalidation in mutable collections, see the
/// reference for the `MutableCollection` and `RangeReplaceableCollection`
/// protocols, as well as for the specific type you're using.
///
/// Accessing Individual Elements
/// =============================
///
/// You can access an element of a collection through its subscript with any
/// valid index except the collection's `endIndex` property, a "past the end"
/// index that does not correspond with any element of the collection.
///
/// Here's an example of accessing the first character in a string through its
/// subscript:
///
///     let firstChar = text.characters[text.characters.startIndex]
///     print(firstChar)
///     // Prints "B"
///
/// The `Collection` protocol declares and provides default implementations for
/// many operations that depend on elements being accessible by their
/// subscript. For example, you can also access the first character of `text`
/// using the `first` property, which has the value of the first element of
/// the collection, or `nil` if the collection is empty.
///
///     print(text.characters.first)
///     // Prints "Optional("B")"
///
/// Traversing a Collection
/// =======================
///
/// Although a sequence can be consumed as it is traversed, a collection is
/// guaranteed to be multipass: Any element may be repeatedly accessed by
/// saving its index. Moreover, a collection's indices form a finite range of
/// the positions of the collection's elements. This guarantees the safety of
/// operations that depend on a sequence being finite, such as checking to see
/// whether a collection contains an element.
///
/// Iterating over the elements of a collection by their positions yields the
/// same elements in the same order as iterating over that collection using
/// its iterator. This example demonstrates that the `characters` view of a
/// string returns the same characters in the same order whether the view's
/// indices or the view itself is being iterated.
///
///     let word = "Swift"
///     for character in word.characters {
///         print(character)
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
///     for i in word.characters.indices {
///         print(word.characters[i])
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
/// Conforming to the Collection Protocol
/// =====================================
///
/// If you create a custom sequence that can provide repeated access to its
/// elements, make sure that its type conforms to the `Collection` protocol in
/// order to give a more useful and more efficient interface for sequence and
/// collection operations. To add `Collection` conformance to your type, you
/// must declare at least the four following requirements:
///
/// - the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties,
/// - a subscript that provides at least read-only access to your type's
///   elements, and
/// - the `index(after:)` method for advancing an index into your collection.
///
/// Expected Performance
/// ====================
///
/// Types that conform to `Collection` are expected to provide the `startIndex`
/// and `endIndex` properties and subscript access to elements as O(1)
/// operations. Types that are not able to guarantee that expected performance
/// must document the departure, because many collection operations depend on
/// O(1) subscripting performance for their own performance guarantees.
///
/// The performance of some collection operations depends on the type of index
/// that the collection provides. For example, a random-access collection,
/// which can measure the distance between two indices in O(1) time, will be
/// able to calculate its `count` property in O(1) time. Conversely, because a
/// forward or bidirectional collection must traverse the entire collection to
/// count the number of contained elements, accessing its `count` property is
/// an O(*n*) operation.
