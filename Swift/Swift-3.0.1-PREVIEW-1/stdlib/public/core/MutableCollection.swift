  // FIXME(ABI)(compiler limitation): there is no reason for this protocol
  // to exist apart from missing compiler features that we emulate with it.
  //
  // This protocol is almost an implementation detail of the standard
  // library; it is used to deduce things like the `SubSequence` and
  // `Iterator` type from a minimal collection, but it is also used in
  // exposed places like as a constraint on `IndexingIterator`.

  /// A type that represents a valid position in the collection.
  ///
  /// Valid indices consist of the position of every element and a
  /// "past the end" position that's not valid for use as a subscript.
  // TODO: swift-3-indexing-model - Index only needs to be comparable or must be comparable..?
  associatedtype Index : Comparable

  /// The position of the first element in a nonempty collection.
  ///
  /// If the collection is empty, `startIndex` is equal to `endIndex`.
  var startIndex: Index { get }

  /// The collection's "past the end" position---that is, the position one
  /// greater than the last valid subscript argument.
  ///
  /// When you need a range that includes the last element of a collection, use
  /// the half-open range operator (`..<`) with `endIndex`. The `..<` operator
  /// creates a range that doesn't include the upper bound, so it's always
  /// safe to use with `endIndex`. For example:
  ///
  ///     let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  ///     if let index = numbers.index(of: 30) {
  ///         print(numbers[index ..< numbers.endIndex])
  ///     }
  ///     // Prints "[30, 40, 50]"
  ///
  /// If the collection is empty, `endIndex` is equal to `startIndex`.
  var endIndex: Index { get }

  // The declaration of _Element and subscript here is a trick used to
  // break a cyclic conformance/deduction that Swift can't handle.  We
  // need something other than a Collection.Iterator.Element that can
  // be used as IndexingIterator<T>'s Element.  Here we arrange for
  // the Collection itself to have an Element type that's deducible from
  // its subscript.  Ideally we'd like to constrain this Element to be the same
  // as Collection.Iterator.Element (see below), but we have no way of
  // expressing it today.
