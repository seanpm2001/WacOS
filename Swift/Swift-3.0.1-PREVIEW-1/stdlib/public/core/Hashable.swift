// FIXME(ABI)(compiler limitation): This protocol exists to identify
// hashable types.  It is used for defining an imitation of a generic
// subscript on `Dictionary<AnyHashable, *>`.
public protocol _Hashable {
  func _toAnyHashable() -> AnyHashable
}

/// A type that provides an integer hash value.
///
/// You can use any type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol in a set or
/// as a dictionary key. Many types in the standard library conform to
/// `Hashable`: strings, integers, floating-point and Boolean values, and even
/// sets provide a hash value by default. Your own custom types can be
/// hashable as well. When you define an enumeration without associated
/// values, it gains `Hashable` conformance automatically, and you can add
/// `Hashable` conformance to your other custom types by adding a single
/// `hashValue` property.
///
/// A hash value, provided by a type's `hashValue` property, is an integer that
/// is the same for any two instances that compare equally. That is, for two
/// instances `a` and `b` of the same type, if `a == b` then
/// `a.hashValue == b.hashValue`. The reverse is not true: Two instances with
/// equal hash values are not necessarily equal to each other.
///
/// - Important: Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different
///   executions of your program. Do not save hash values to use during a
///   future execution.
///
/// Conforming to the Hashable Protocol
/// ===================================
///
/// To use your own custom type in a set or as the key type of a dictionary,
/// add `Hashable` conformance to your type by providing a `hashValue`
/// property. The `Hashable` protocol inherits from the `Equatable` protocol,
/// so you must also add an equal-to operator (`==`) function for your
/// custom type.
///
/// As an example, consider a `GridPoint` type that describes a location in a
/// grid of buttons. Here's the initial declaration of the `GridPoint` type:
///
///     /// A point in an x-y coordinate system.
///     struct GridPoint {
///         var x: Int
///         var y: Int
///     }
///
/// You'd like to create a set of the grid points where a user has already
/// tapped. Because the `GridPoint` type is not hashable yet, it can't be used
/// as the `Element` type for a set. To add `Hashable` conformance, provide an
/// `==` operator function and a `hashValue` property.
///
///     extension GridPoint: Hashable {
///         var hashValue: Int {
///             return x.hashValue ^ y.hashValue
///         }
///
///         static func == (lhs: GridPoint, rhs: GridPoint) -> Bool {
///             return lhs.x == rhs.x && lhs.y == rhs.y
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `hashValue` property in this example combines the hash values of a grid
/// point's `x` and `y` values using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`). The `^`
/// operator is one way to combine two integer values into a single value.
///
/// - Note: Set and dictionary performance depends on hash values that minimize
///   collisions for their associated element and key types, respectively.
///
/// Now that `GridPoint` conforms to the `Hashable` protocol, you can create a
/// set of previously tapped grid points.
///
///     var tappedPoints: Set = [GridPoint(x: 2, y: 3), GridPoint(x: 4, y: 1)]
///     let nextTap = GridPoint(x: 0, y: 1)
///     if tappedPoints.contains(nextTap) {
///         print("Already tapped at (\(nextTap.x), \(nextTap.y)).")
///     } else {
///         tappedPoints.insert(nextTap)
///         print("New tap detected at (\(nextTap.x), \(nextTap.y)).")
///     }
///     // Prints "New tap detected at (0, 1).")
