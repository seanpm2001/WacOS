/// Creates a sequence of pairs built out of two underyling sequences.
///
/// In the `Zip2Sequence` instance returned by this function, the elements of
/// the *i*th pair are the *i*th elements of each underlying sequence. The
/// following example uses the `zip(_:_:)` function to iterate over an array
/// of strings and a countable range at the same time:
///
///     let words = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
///     let numbers = 1...4
///
///     for (word, number) in zip(words, numbers) {
///         print("\(word): \(number)")
///     }
///     // Prints "one: 1"
///     // Prints "two: 2
///     // Prints "three: 3"
///     // Prints "four: 4"
///
/// If the two sequences passed to `zip(_:_:)` are different lengths, the
/// resulting sequence is the same length as the shorter sequence. In this
/// example, the resulting array is the same length as `words`:
///
///     let naturalNumbers = 1...Int.max
///     let zipped = Array(zip(words, naturalNumbers))
///     // zipped == [("one", 1), ("two", 2), ("three", 3), ("four", 4)]
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - sequence1: The first sequence or collection to zip.
///   - sequence2: The second sequence or collection to zip.
/// - Returns: A sequence of tuple pairs, where the elements of each pair are
///   corresponding elements of `sequence1` and `sequence2`.
