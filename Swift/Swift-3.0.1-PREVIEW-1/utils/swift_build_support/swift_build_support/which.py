# A naive reimplementation of shutil.which() for Python 2.7. This can be
# removed if shutil.which() is backported, or if the Swift build toolchain
# migrates completely to Python 3.3+.

    Return the path to an executable which would be run if
    the given cmd was called. If no cmd would be called, return None.

    Python 3.3+ provides this behavior via the shutil.which() function;
    see: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/shutil.html#shutil.which

    We provide our own implementation because shutil.which() has not
    been backported to Python 2.7, which we support.
