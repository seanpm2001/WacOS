/// Simplify invocations of builtin operations that may overflow.
/// All such operations return a tuple (result, overflow_flag).
/// This function try to simplify such operations, but returns only a
/// simplified first element of a tuple. The overflow flag is not returned
/// explicitly, because this simplification is only possible if there is
/// no overflow. Therefore the overflow flag is known to have a value of 0 if
/// simplification was successful.
/// In case when a simplification is not possible, a null SILValue is returned.
