# About the social preview directory

The social preview directory contains data related to social media previews of repositories. On GitHub projects, this data is located at `<branchNameHere>/.github/SocialPreview/`

GitHub has a 1.00 megabyte (1,000,000 bytes or 1,048,576 bytes, I am not sure if GitHub uses base 2 or base 10 binary prefix numbering) image upload limit. Images I wanted to use but couldn't are located in `<branchNameHere>/.github/SocialPreview/UnusedAssets/`

These images currently only show when searching for repositories or searching through label. They don't show up anywhere else (as of March 18th 2021) with these preview templates, sharing a link to this repository will show the preview image, rather than my GitHub profile picture or organization profile picture.

The standard template is also included, but isn't used.

These previews started getting added to repositories on March 17th 2021 during a new repository update period, which included new features to add to all new repositories.

Included files are in PNG, JPG/JPEG, or SVG format.
