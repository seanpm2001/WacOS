; Project language file 2
; For: WacTVOS/Master
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the second project language for this project (WacOS/WacTVOS/) because Assembly is a very low level language that can access the required sections of memory needed for parts of this project, and is the default second base language for all WacTVOS subsystem projects. It will be used along C (and possibly Objective-C/Objective-C++) at the system level for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
