# WacTVOS

WacTVOS is an open source recreation of Apple's tvOS (spanning from versions 8 to 16). It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

| [Predecessor: wOS 7](https://github.com/seanpm2001/wOS_7) [Local](/) | [Successor: Incumbent](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacTVOS) [Local](/WacTVOS/) |
|---|---|

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Swift, Objective-C, Objective-C++, and AppleScript, and more.

### Programming language support

Objective-C is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of Wac OS X 10.6)

Swift is supported in versions 10.9 and up

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.
