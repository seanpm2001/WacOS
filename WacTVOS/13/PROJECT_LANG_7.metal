// Project language 7
// For: WacOS/WacTVOS 13
// About:
// I chose Metal as the seventh project language for this project (WacOS/WacTVOS/13) as Metal is an Apple language I want to emulate and resemble it here for cross compatibility and software diversity reasons. It is being used in specific APIs within the system, and may replace GLSL/HLSL in some areas. I decided to resemble all Apple languages through their usage on WacTVOS subsystem projects, and this is the 7th (and currently final) official language in use here. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
