# WacTVOS 8

WacTVOS 8 is an open source recreation of Apple's tvOS (version 8, when it was still called iOS). It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

| [**Predecessor:** `(wOS 7)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/wOS_7) [`(Local`)](/) | [**Successor:** `WacTVOS 9`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacTVOS_9) [`(Local)`](/WacTVOS/9/) |
|---|---|

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Swift, Objective-C, Objective-C++, and AppleScript, and more.

### Programming language support

C starts at version C11

Assembly is x86 Assembly

Objective-C starts at version 2.0

Objective-C++ starts at version ??

AppleScript starts at version 2.5

Swift starts at version 2.0

Metal starts at version ??

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match tvOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.

## Home repositories

### WacTVOS 8

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacTVOS_8/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.

[Home repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/WacOS-dev/WacTVOS/8/)

This is the home repository. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.

### WacOS Pure

This system is not considered "pure" while at the same time, it is. It is a problem I am still trying to work out. The "pure" version would be a wOS variant (8) that has WacTVOS functionality, while at the same time, it is being merged here.

WacOS Pure is a standards set that ensures that WacOS matches the Apple equivalent without malicious methods.
