_The above image is an example of the acid2 test being completed successfully._

Acid2 is a test page for web browsers developed in 2005 April 13th as a way to test and measure interoperability between web browsers. It was superseded by the [acid3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/acid3) test in 2005, April 13th

## Compliance

Web browsers at the time worked on becoming compliant with the Acid2 standards test. Internet Explorer was the slowest of the big browsers to catch on.

Below is a chart of the usage share of web browsers that passed the test.
