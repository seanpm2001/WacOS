Squeak is an object oriented, class based, reflective programming language based on SmallTalk 80 originally by Apple, but development later went to Walt Disney, then it became its own community project.

Squeak uses its own interface, known as Morphic.

Notable projects that use Squeak include:

1. Scratch (for versions 1.0 to 1.4)

2. Usage is seen in the Nintendo ES Operating system.
