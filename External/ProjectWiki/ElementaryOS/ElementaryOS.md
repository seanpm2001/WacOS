# WacOS and ElementaryOS

I would like to clear this up first thing: I have no problem(s) with ElementaryOS, and I believe that we can co-exist without problem.

I have been aware of ElementaryOS for over a year now, but I have noted last night (2021 September 12th) that I need to clarify the difference in the projects.

## Linux

ElementaryOS is based on the Long Term Support (LTS) release of Ubuntu, and aims to be a ethical replacement to MacOS. Being based on Ubuntu, ElementaryOS is technically Debian-based. I have also noted that ElementaryOS contains a heavy amount of Vala code, which is good for software diversity.

WacOS is still in development, and I have not decided on a distribution to base it on, but I have confirmed it will be Linux based. I am looking for a distribution to base it on that allows for maximum customization ability, and never needs more than 0.99 gigabytes of RAM.

## Desktop environment

ElementaryOS uses a modified version of the GNOME Desktop Environment that aims to look and feel as much like MacOS as possible, while still giving user freedom. If you really want, you could switch it to KDE, or other desktop environments, but it would kind of defeat the purpose.

WacOS is based on a customized version of the custom Skeuowie desktop environment, which emphasizes Skeuormorphism, but this modification allows for versions of MacOS and iOS UI elements that are flat design (example: iOS 7 and up, OS X 10.10 and up)

I am going to go on a little longer here, as WacOS is heavily UI based in its original plans. WacOS plans to imitate the interface of EVERY version of every Apple operating system and software piece, whether it be Aqua, Steel, Carbon, or the likes. For copyright reasons, the UI may need to be applied in a custom 3rd party way. WacOS has customization options, so that it can look like any Apple operating system on the fly.

WacOS will also support other Linux desktop environments, although it is also not recommended, as it defeats the purpose.

## Application support

ElementaryOS can run most Linux programs, although I am unsure what else it can run.

WacOS is designed to run standard Linux programs, but it also has special experimental support for MacOS, NewtonOS, iPhoneOS, iPadOS, and iOS applications in an open source reverse-engineered way.

## File system

ElementaryOS typically uses the EXT4 file system as far as I know, I am sure other file systems are also supported in some fashion.

WacOS supports 6 file system types, which include EXT4, BRTFS, OpenZFS, and experimental open source variants of HFS, HFS+, and APFS.

## Hardware

ElementaryOS will run on any device that can run Ubuntu or other Linux distributions, which is a very wide array of devices.

WacOS has the same goal.

## Summary

ElementaryOS and WacOS are different projects with different goals. We can continue to develop and co-exist, there doesn't need to be competition. You have the free choice to choose any operating system you want, it doesn't have to be one or the other. I originally designed WacOS for distro hoppers that like/love the Apple UI experience, and virtual machine enthusiasts, but it has expanded to be much more. ElementaryOS has similar goals.

TL;DR: ElementaryOS â‰  WacOS (ElementaryOS is not equal to WacOS)

Side note: this projects Wiki is pretty out of date, and is going to be modified heavily in the coming weeks (if I can remember)

## Sources

Coming soon, although right now, most information comes from the ElementaryOS Wikipedia article, and the various repositories on GitHub for the ElementaryOS project. I also base some information on general knowledge of Linux.
