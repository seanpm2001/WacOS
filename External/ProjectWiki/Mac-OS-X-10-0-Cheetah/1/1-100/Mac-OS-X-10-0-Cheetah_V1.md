( **Predecessor:** [Mac OS X Public Beta](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-Public-Beta/) | **Successor:** [Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-1-Puma/) )

Mac OS X 10.0 (code named Cheetah) is the first major release and version of macOS, Apple's desktop and server operating system. Mac OS X 10.0 was released on March 24, 2001 for a price of US$129. It was the successor of the [Mac OS X Public Beta](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-Public-Beta/) and the predecessor of [Mac OS X 10.1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-1-Puma/) (code named Puma).

Mac OS X 10.0 was a radical departure from the classic Mac OS and was Apple's long-awaited answer for a next generation Macintosh operating system. It introduced a brand new code base completely separate from [Mac OS 9's](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-9/) as well as all previous Apple operating systems, and had a new Unix-like core, Darwin, which features a new memory management system. Unlike releases of [Mac OS X 10.2](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-2-Jaguar/) to [10.8](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OS-X-10-8-Lion/), the operating system was not externally marketed with the name of a big cat.

## Features

* Dock — the Dock was a new way of organizing one's Mac OS X applications on a user interface, and a change from the classic method of Application launching in previous Mac OS systems.

* OSFMK 7.3 — the Open Software Foundation Mach kernel from the OSF[3] was part of the XNU kernel for Mac OS X, and was one of the largest changes from a technical standpoint in Mac OS X.

* Terminal — the Terminal was a feature that allowed access to Mac OS X's underpinnings, namely the Unix core. Mac OS had previously had the distinction of being one of the few operating systems with no command line interface at all.[citation needed]

* Mail — email client.

* Address Book

* [TextEdit](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/TextEdit/) — new on-board word processor, replacement to SimpleText.

* Full preemptive multitasking support, a long-awaited feature on the Mac.

* PDF Support (create PDFs from any application)

* [Aqua UI](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Aqua_(User_Interface)) — new user interface

* Built on Darwin, a Unix-like operating system.

* OpenGL

* [AppleScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/AppleScript/)

* Support for Carbon and Cocoa APIs

* [Sherlock](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Sherlock/) — desktop and web search engine.
    
* Protected memory — memory protection so that if an application corrupts its memory, the memory of other applications will not be corrupted.

## Limitations

* File-sharing client — The system can only use TCP/IP, not AppleTalk, to connect to servers sharing the Apple Filing Protocol. It cannot use SMB to connect to Windows or Samba servers.
    
* File-sharing server — As a server, the system can share files using only the Apple Filing Protocol (over TCP/IP), HTTP, SSH, and FTP.

## Multilingual snags

Mac OS X 10.0 began a short era (that ended with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar's release) where Apple offered two types of installation CDs: 1Z and 2Z CDs. The difference in the two lay in the extent of multilingual support.

Input method editors of Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean were only included with the 2Z CDs. They also came with more languages (the full set of 15 languages), whereas the 1Z CDs came only with about eight languages and could not actually display simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese and/or Korean (except for the Chinese characters present in Japanese Kanji). A variant of 2Z CDs were introduced when Mac OS X v10.0.3 was released to the Asian market (this variant could not be upgraded to version 10.0.4). The brief period of multilingual confusion ended with the release of v10.2. Currently, all Mac OS X installer CDs and preinstallations include the full set of 15 languages and full multilingual compatibility.
