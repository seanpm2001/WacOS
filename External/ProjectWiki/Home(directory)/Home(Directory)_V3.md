# Home (directory)

[Go back (WacOS/Wiki)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki)

The home directory is the main user folder for WacOS. It is located in the root directory, and it contains all the users files (such as images, videos, program data, etc) it is separate from system files.

It is designed to follow the UNIX file structure, and also the MacOS file structure. If there have been changes to this over the years, support for swapping the home directory, along with other default directories from MacOS will be added.

## Path

Main path (Linux): `/home/<username>/`

Main path (XNU): `Unknown`

Default path on System 1-6: `Unknown`

Default path on MacOS 7 to 9: `Unknown`

Default path on Mac OS X 10-?: `unknown`

Default path on iPhoneOS 1-3: `unknown`

Default path on iOS 4-?: `unknown`

**Research is needed on this.**
