_The above image is an example of the acid3 test being completed successfully._

Acid3 is a test page for web browsers developed in 2008 March 3rd as a way to test and measure interoperability between web browsers. It currently has no successor (as of 2021 Thursday, September 16th at 10:38 pm, one is obviously not coming tonight.)

## Criticism

The acid3 test was criticized for being a cherry-picked test for wanted features and not an actual test of interoperability. Some privacy breaking features were originally present, and they were removed after criticism by Mozilla.

Over the years, most browsers became non-compliant with the test:

## Compliance

Web browsers at the time worked on becoming compliant with the Acid3 standard tests, although it wasn't completely compliant on Firefox immediately, as Mozilla was hard at work on Firefox 3.0. Over a period of a couple years, compliance became 100%, however as of Firefox 67.0.2, the test falls short of passing, as it is getting very old and outdated, or there is something that browsers can't implement anymore due to compatibility or ethical problems:

## Failed test

Internet Explorer 8 handles the Acid3 test very poorly. It didn't improve much until Internet Explorer was discontinued, then there were no test to pass. All joking aside, I have not tested it myself, so an additional source is needed for the Acid3 compliance of IE11.
