# Articles to write (WacOS Wiki)

This project has become a strong Apple Wiki, and it expands outside the scope of just WacOS. Articles should still be based on WacOS when possible, but also contain info on Apple - 2021 Saturday September 18th

## Needs update

> - [ ] All articles that don't have a article info footer need to be updated

> - [ ] Several articles need to be updated to include WacOS info alongside Apple info

> - [ ] All year articles need lots of info on dates of events

> - [ ] Hardware articles need more info

> - [ ] Homepage needs an update to include graphics, improved links, and better info on the Wikis purpose and guidelines. - 2021 September 18th

> - [ ] I have noted that I made a research error with the ElementaryOS article, the developers claim they don't want to be associated with MacOS or be a MacOS article, but the developers still want to be an alternative to MacOS. There will need to be a correction

> - [ ] Several Apple software products need WacOS equivalents - 2021 September 20th

> - [ ] Find and include beta versions and beta software info for various MacOS software - 2021 September 22nd

**Total entries:** `8` **Completed:** `0`

## Development notes

These are the development notes for this page.

### Revision errors

Notes: Revision 4 was a mistake, I accidentally auto-published. I am not going to count it, I am going to count revision 5 as revision 4, revision 6 as revision 5, and so on.

Due to this error and suddenly stopping the naming scheme, I am going to clarify what archived revision means what, until the problem can be reversed:

Version 4 is version 5

Version 5 is version 6

Version 6 is version 7

Version 7 is version 8

Version 8 is version 9

Version 9 is version 4

I have stopped this naming scheme, it is too confusing. - As of revision 10, or revision X

### Obsession

I admit, I have become a bit too obsessed with Apple recently in my research, despite owning no Apple products or software that is still in use. I feel it is important to be enthusiastic if I am going to talk about and research something. I just enjoy writing this Wiki in my free time. I hope others can too someday, once I figure out how to make Wiki editing more friendly and less subject to abuse (I don't want some random person to come in, take everything out and write something bad) - 2021 Friday September 17th

### Piling on

I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list. - 2021 September 18th
