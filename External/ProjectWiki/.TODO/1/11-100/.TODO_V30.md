# Articles to write (WacOS Wiki)

![https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/blob/master/Graphics/MacWrite/MacWrite-software-icon.png](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/blob/master/Graphics/MacWrite/MacWrite-software-icon.png)

I have recently noted the importance of the project Wiki, and I want to improve this projects Wiki. Here are the articles I plan to write - Early 2021 September

This project has become a strong Apple Wiki, and it expands outside the scope of just WacOS. Articles should still be based on WacOS when possible, but also contain info on Apple - 2021 Saturday September 18th

**Articles to write:** `667` _(this number will continue to go up over time, as more topics are found during research)_

**Articles written so far:** `204` / `667` (30.58%) _Note: the homepage, footer, and sidebar are also included in this count._

**Stats are as of 2021 Wednesday September 29th at 7:04 pm**

</details>

**Total entries:** `667` **Completed:** `204` _(as the footer, homepage, and sidebar are counted)_

**Current completion status (as of 2021 Wednesday, September 29th at 7:04 pm):** `30.58%`

<details>
	<summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the total percentage estimate mathematical formula</p></summary>

**Percent complete calculation formula:** `completed` `y` `/` `total` `x` _=_ `answer`, **or** `y` `/` `x`

( `completed` == `y` | `total` == `x` | `answer` == `sum` )

**Important notes:**

`don't let the decimal confuse you`

`don't divide x by y, instead divide y by x`

`if your calculator puts zeroes before the decimal, that is a normal calculator. Pretend that the number 10-99 comes after the 0, and once it passes 99.99, it goes to 100.00` (I don't know how to explain this better)

</details>

**Other notes (not related to the formula)**

_I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list._

```markdown

is equal to:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo

- [x] Bar
```

is equal to:

- [ ] Foo

- [x] Bar

Alternatively, this works:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo
- [x] Bar
```

Note the lack of a blank line between each box. I choose to add the blank line, as some of my markdown viewers (including the one on GitHub in some spots) have problems if I don't separate things with spaces, and will format like this:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo-[x] Bar
```

## Development notes

These are the development notes for this page.

### Revision errors

<details>
	<summary>[Click/tap here to expand the list of revision errors for this page]</p></summary>

Notes: Revision 4 was a mistake, I accidentally auto-published. I am not going to count it, I am going to count revision 5 as revision 4, revision 6 as revision 5, and so on.

Due to this error and suddenly stopping the naming scheme, I am going to clarify what archived revision means what, until the problem can be reversed:

Version 4 is version 5

Version 5 is version 6

Version 6 is version 7

Version 7 is version 8

Version 8 is version 9

Version 9 is version 4

I have stopped this naming scheme, it is too confusing. - As of revision 10, or revision X

</details>

### Obsession

I admit, I have become a bit too obsessed with Apple recently in my research, despite owning no Apple products or software that is still in use. I feel it is important to be enthusiastic if I am going to talk about and research something. I just enjoy writing this Wiki in my free time. I hope others can too someday, once I figure out how to make Wiki editing more friendly and less subject to abuse (I don't want some random person to come in, take everything out and write something bad) - 2021 Friday September 17th

It has become a daily routine, and I have spent at least 40 hours writing this Wiki so far this month. It is starting to impact my life negatively, so I may stop in early October/slow down heavily, although I still really enjoy writing the Wiki. - 2021 September 28th

### Piling on

I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list. - 2021 September 18th

## Article notes

This section contains subsections for my active notes on writing various articles for this projects Wiki. Originally commented out prior to version 28 of this article, they have been made more accessible via dropdown menus.
