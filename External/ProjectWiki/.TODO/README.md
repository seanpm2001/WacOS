**Total entries:** `336` **Completed:** `47` (as the footer, homepage, and sidebar are counted)

**Current completion status (as of 2021 Saturday, September 18th at 3:40 pm):** `13.99%` (formula: completed(y) / total(x) = answer, or y / x, don't let the decimal confuse you)

I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list.

## Needs update

> - [ ] All articles that don't have a article info footer need to be updated

> - [ ] Several articles need to be updated to include WacOS info alongside Apple info

> - [ ] All year articles need lots of info on dates of events

> - [ ] Hardware articles need more info

> - [ ] Homepage needs an update to include graphics, improved links, and better info on the Wikis purpose and guidelines. - 2021 September 18th

## Development notes

These are the development notes for this page.

### Revision errors

Notes: Revision 4 was a mistake, I accidentally auto-published. I am not going to count it, I am going to count revision 5 as revision 4, revision 6 as revision 5, and so on.

I have stopped this naming scheme, it is too confusing. - As of revision 10, or revision X

### Obsession

I admit, I have become a bit too obsessed with Apple recently in my research, despite owning no Apple products or software that is still in use. I feel it is important to be enthusiastic if I am going to talk about and research something. I just enjoy writing this Wiki in my free time. I hope others can too someday, once I figure out how to make Wiki editing more friendly and less subject to abuse (I don't want some random person to come in, take everything out and write something bad) - 2021 Friday September 17th

### Piling on

I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list. - 2021 September 18th
