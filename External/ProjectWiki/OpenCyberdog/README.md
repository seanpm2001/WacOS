_Not to be confused with [Cyberdog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Cyberdog)_

OpenCyberdog is a recreation of Cyberdog, an early web browser suite developed by Apple Inc. This recreation has similar levels of features and compatibility, and is meant to be used as a basic, legacy web browser. For modern systems, it is recommended to use [Savannah](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Savannah), [Firefox](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Firefox/), or [another browser](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Browser_list).
