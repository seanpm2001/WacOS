## Background

Windows 2.0 is an obsoleted 16-bit Microsoft Windows GUI-based operating environment that was released on December 9, 1987, and the successor to Windows 1.0.

This product's family includes Windows 2.0, a base edition for 8086 real mode, and Windows/386 2.0, an enhanced edition for i386 protected mode.

On December 31, 2001, Microsoft declared Windows 2.0 obsolete and stopped providing support and updates for the system.

## Apple Inc. Lawsuit

On March 17, [1988](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/1988/), Apple Inc. filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, accusing them of violating copyrights Apple held on the Macintosh System Software. Apple claimed the "look and feel" of the Macintosh operating system, taken as a whole, was protected by copyright and that Windows 2.0 violated this copyright by having the same icons. The judge ruled in favor of Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft on all but 10 of the 189 graphical user interface elements that Apple sued on, and the court found the remaining 10 GUI elements could not be copyrighted.
