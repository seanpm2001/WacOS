# Skeuwoie

_Not to be confused with [WacOS Desktop environment](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/WacOS_DE/)_

Skeuowie is a skeuomorphic desktop environment (SDE) project for UNIX-like systems, created by [seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) it is purely skeuomorphic, low memory, and highly customizable. It is similar to KDE in several ways, but offers skeuomorphic, detailed graphics. Its main focus is skeuomorphism, and will never use flat design (such as Material Design, Fluent Design, and other types of low detail graphic design methods)

By default, WacOS will use a heavily modified version of my [Skeuowie desktop environment](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie/tree/main) but will offer other desktop environments as a backup, and as a choice.

Currently, the following 4 Desktop Environments are supported:

[Skeuowie with WacOS theme](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie/tree/main) (Planned default)

[KDE Plasma 5](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop) (Backup 1) - Currently the default until Skeuowie is more developed

[GNOME 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_3) (Extra 1)

[GNOME 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_2) (Extra 2)
