# PowerPC Processor Support

![https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/blob/master/Graphics/PowerPC/PowerPC_logo.svg](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/blob/master/Graphics/PowerPC/PowerPC_logo.svg)

## Overview

WacOS plans to support the PowerPC processor architecture for legacy purposes. Unless you own an old computer with a PowerPC processor, it is likely this architecture will only be supported in virtual machines and emulation.

## About

The PowerPC line of processors was a line of 32 bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) computer processors by the AIM alliance (Apple Inc, IBM, Motorola) that lasted from 1991 to 2006, before it was discontinued, renamed to Power ISA, and given to IBM, where it is still continued to this day.

All versions of PowerPC are planned to be supported.
