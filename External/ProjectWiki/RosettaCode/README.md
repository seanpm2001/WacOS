## Description

Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another. Rosetta Code currently has 1,139 tasks, 300 draft tasks, and is aware of 841 languages, though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every language.

The above description is taken from [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)

Rosetta Code is a play-on-words/inspiration from the Rosetta Stone, an Ancient stone that helped translate various Ancient languages, including Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek.
