iPhoneOS 1 (originally not named as anything, just referred to as OS X for phones) was the first version of the iOS series of operating systems. Its name didn't change from iOS until iOS 4.

iPhoneOS 1 was released on June 29th 2007 and ran on the original iPhone (the iPhone 2G) along with the iPod Touch (1st generation) it was a very basic operating system that could do everything a phone could do at the time, but was revolutionary, as it was also the first smartphone operating system, meaning it could do other things like view/take pictures and videos, calculate, browse the Internet, and more.

Apple had to acquire gesture software to be able to build it, as iOS is gesture based. It went through a long development period, and was the turning point for Apple history in the 21st century.

It was succeeded by [iPhone OS 2](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-2/) on July 11th 2008. It received a few updates, including an iPod Touch only update, version 1.1.3, which costs $19.95 to upgrade to.

As like other Apple operating systems, iPhoneOS 1 is proprietary software.
