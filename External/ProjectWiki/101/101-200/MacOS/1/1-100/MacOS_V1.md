# MacOS

( **Preceeded by:** [LisaOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/LisaOS/) | **Current version** `15.0 beta 7 (2021 September 21st)` )

MacOS is a series of graphical user interface (GUI) focused operating systems by Apple Inc. since 1984, starting with [System Software 1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Apple-System-1) in 1984, it was the main operating system for the [Macintosh 128K](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Macintosh-128K/) its development continued, and improvements were made. Over time, Apple as a company began to go into hard times. With the failure of the [Copland](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Copland/) and [Rhapsody](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Rhapsody/) projects, and continued decreasing sales, [MacOS 9](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-9/) was released. A grassroots save Apple trend started, and users upgraded to the new system, and some pirate groups refused to redistribute it for the time being.

MacOS received a massive overhaul in 2000 with the release of the [Mac OS X public beta](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-Public-beta/) and the successor system [Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/) this release and its subsequent releases helped save Apple. The releases followed a big cat naming scheme (Cheetah, Puma, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion) until the release of [OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OS-X-10-9-Mavericks/) where a California name trend started. Mac OS X became OS X with the release of [OS X 10.7 (Lion)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OS-X-10-7/) and subsequently changed to just MacOS with the release of [MacOS 10.12 (Sierra)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-10-12-Sierra/)

MacOS featured a highly detailed Skeuomorphic design style, until it was switched to flat design with [OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OS-X-10-10/) up until [MacOS 10.15 (Catalina)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-10-15-Catalina/) MacOS had 10 in its version number. The next release (MacOS 11.0 (Big Sur))](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-11-0-Big-Sur/) was significant, and it jumped from version 10 to 11, the first time in 20 years. It then jumped again to 12.0 with the release of [MacOS 12 (Monterey)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-12-0-Monterey/) in 2021.

In 2007, Apple began putting their efforts into the [iPhoneOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS/) (later [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/)) mobile operating system. It did not replace MacOS.
