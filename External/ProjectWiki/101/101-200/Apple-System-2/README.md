( **Predecessor:** [System 1/System 1.1 (1984)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Apple-System-1/) | **Successor:** [System 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Apple-System-3/) )

Apple System 2 is the second version of the then-to-be classic MacOS series of operating systems produced by Apple Inc.

System 2.0 added support for AppleTalk and the newly introduced LaserWriter to use it.

System 2.1 (Finder 5.0) introduced the Hierarchical File System (HFS) which has real directories. This version was specifically to support the Hard Disk 20 and only implements HFS in RAM; startup and most floppy disks remain MFS 400 K volumes.
