# Sir Isaac NewtonScript

( **Based on:** [NewtonScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NewtonScript/) | **Written in:** [C++](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/C-Plus-Plus/), [Self](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Self/) | **Platform:** [Sir Isaac NewtonOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Sir-Isaac-NewtonOS/) )

Sir Isaac NewtonScript is a subproject within the WacOS operating system project to recreate an open source version/variant of Apples [NewtonScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NewtonScript/) programming language. It will be similar in ways like the language it is written in and the platform and specs it aims to go for (128k RAM, touch-based operating system) but its design will be completely different for originality, and in case [NewtonScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NewtonScript/) becomes open source in the future.

It is the default language used on the [Sir Isaac Newton Operating System](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Sir-Isaac-NewtonOS/) which is a subsystem of the WacOS project. It will be written in the [C++](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/C-Plus-Plus/) and [Self](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Self/) programming languages, and will follow the standards of lightweightedness for the level of pre-1991 software. It will also feature extra customization ability, and similar abilities of the WacOS operating system, such as being [Linux](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Linux/) / [XNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/XNU/) based, running on non-Apple hardware natively, etc.
