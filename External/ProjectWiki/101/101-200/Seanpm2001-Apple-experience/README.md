# Seanpm2001s Apple experience

I have had a long experience with Apple. I started off with an iPod Touch (4th generation) in late 2009/early 2010. It didn't have much memory (8 gigabytes has never been enough for me) and after about 3 years, and a few replacements, I switched to an iPod Touch (5th generation) as of 2021 September 23rd, this was my last Apple device.

I grew to truly love the [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/), [5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-5/), and [6](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-6/)'s interface. I would later grow to love it more than Windows XPs Luna, Silver, and Olive Green interface, which is my 2nd favorite graphical shell. 

I had lots of games on my original iPod and I took lots of notes. One time when visiting an Apple store to repair the notes app (which began to refuse to open) I was asked how I managed to get an extra blank homepage. I am not sure how I did that either.

I have lots of memories with iOS. I went on many long car rides, and casual game periods with it. I began moving from Apple to Android in 2011-2015, slowly, but gradually, I switched from iOS to Android. The progression got really fast in 2015 when I got my first functional phone. It had the 8 gigabyte problem (Samsung Galaxy Core Prime) and I had issue with it, until I again switched to the 32 gigabyte model of the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Even that wasn't enough in 2018.

I really like Apples UI up to [iOS 6](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-6/) and [OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OS-X-10-9-Mavericks/) but when Apple switched to flat design, it really sucked. I never upgraded above iOS 6, and I have never owned a Mac or have had MacOS as a primary operating system (although I tried unsuccessfully to get [Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-6-Snow-Leopard/) to install in a virtual machine, I still can't figure out how to get iOS to work in a virtual machine)

A lot of people seem to have turned on skeuomorphism. I haven't. I absolutely hate flat design, and I am still longing for a preference option to have skeuomorphism on my main system again, for now its GNOME 3, which at least has some gradient, so it isn't all flat.

My last iPod bent in my pocket when sitting down, and you can see all the lights inside of it. It still worked, up until I completely wore out the charging cable (something I frequently do with mobile devices, I have learned not to use a phone while its plugged in, I have broke 6 devices this way) I fully switched to Android in 2015, and my iPod hasn't been turned on in years. I doubt it still works.

I have recently became interested in Apple again starting in 2017, and research has been done from time to time from this point onward. In 2021 September, I went through a huge Apple phase during research for the [WacOS wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/) project. This is still ongoing. I don't plan on owning any Apple hardware anymore, but I still plan to try and get an Apple-based virtual machine running in the near future.
