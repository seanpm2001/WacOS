# Sir Isaac NewtonOS

( **Written in:** [Sir Isaac NewtonScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Sir-Isaac-NewtonScript/) | | **Platform:** `Various tablet form devices prior to 1991`)

Sir Isaac NewtonOS is a subproject within the WacOS operating system project to recreate an open source version/variant of Apples [Newton OS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NewtonOS/) Operating System. It will be similar in ways like the language it is written in and the platform and specs it aims to go for (128k RAM, touch-based operating system) but its design will be completely different for originality, and in case [NewtonOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NewtonOS) becomes open source in the future.

[Sir Isaac Newton Operating System](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Sir-Isaac-NewtonOS/) is a subsystem of the WacOS project. It will follow the standards of lightweightedness for the level of pre-1991 software. It will also feature extra customization ability, and similar abilities of the WacOS operating system, such as being [Linux](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Linux/) / [XNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/XNU/) based, running on non-Apple hardware natively, etc.
