( **Predecessor:** [Mac OS 8 (1997)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-8/) | **Successors:** [Mac OS X Public Beta (2000)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-Public-Beta) & [Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah) (2001)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/) & [Mac OS X Server 1.0 (2000)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-Server-1-0/) )

<!-- Mac OS 9 is the ninth major version of the classic MacOS series of operating systems produced by Apple Inc, the final release in the Classic MacOS series of operating systems. !-->

Mac OS 9 is the ninth major release of Apple's classic Mac OS operating system which was succeeded by [OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/). Introduced on October 23, [1999](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/1999/), it was promoted by Apple as "The Best Internet Operating System Ever", highlighting Sherlock 2's Internet search capabilities, integration with Apple's free online services known as iTools and improved Open Transport networking. While Mac OS 9 lacks protected memory and full pre-emptive multitasking, lasting improvements include the introduction of an automated Software Update engine and support for multiple users.

Apple discontinued development of Mac OS 9 in late [2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2001/), transitioning all future development to [Mac OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/). The final updates to Mac OS 9 addressed compatibility issues with [Mac OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/) while running in the Classic Environment and compatibility with Carbon applications. At the [2002](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2002/) Worldwide Developers Conference, Steve Jobs began his keynote address by staging a mock funeral for OS 9.

## Features

Apple billed Mac OS 9 as including "50 new features" and heavily marketed its Sherlock 2 software, which introduced a "channels" feature for searching different online resources and introduced a [QuickTime](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/QuickTime/)-like metallic appearance. Mac OS 9 also featured integrated support for Apple's suite of Internet services known as iTools (later re-branded as .Mac, then MobileMe, which was replaced by iCloud) and included improved TCP/IP functionality with Open Transport 2.5.

Other features new to Mac OS 9 include:

Integrated support for multiple user accounts without using At Ease.

Support for voice login through VoicePrint passwords.

Keychain, a feature allowing users to save passwords and textual data encrypted in protected keychains.

A Software Update control panel for automatic download and installation of Apple system software updates.

A redesigned Sound control panel and support for USB audio.

Speakable Items 2.0, also known as PlainTalk, featuring improved speech synthesis and recognition along with [AppleScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/AppleScript/) integration.

Improved font management through FontSync.

Remote Access Personal Server 3.5, including support for TCP/IP clients over Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

An updated version of [AppleScript](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/AppleScript/) with support for TCP/IP.

Personal File Sharing over TCP/IP.

USB Printer Sharing, a control panel allowing certain USB printers to be shared across a TCP/IP network.

128-bit file encryption in the Finder.

Support for files larger than 2 GB.

Unix volume support.

CD Burning in the Finder (introduced in Mac OS 9.1).

Addition of a "Window" menu to the Finder (introduced in Mac OS 9.1)

## Mac OS 9 and the Classic Environment

[PowerPC](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/PowerPC/) versions of Mac OS X prior to [10.5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-5-Leopard/) include a compatibility layer (a shell) called Classic, enabling users to run applications and hardware requiring Mac OS 9 from within OS X. This is achieved through running Mac OS 9 without access to its Finder inside OS X. This requires Mac OS 9 to be installed on the computer even though computers that can run the Classic environment are not necessarily able to boot into Mac OS 9. Some Mac OS 9 applications do not run well in Classic. They demonstrate screen redraw problems and lagging performance. In addition, some drivers and other software which directly interact with the hardware fail to work properly.

In May [2002](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2002/), at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, Steve Jobs, accompanied by a coffin, held a mock funeral to announce that Apple had stopped development of Mac OS 9. Mac OS 9.2.2, released in December [2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2001/), was the final version of Mac OS 9 and the "classic" Mac OS. In June 2005, Jobs announced that the Macintosh platform would be transitioning to Intel x86 microprocessors. Developer documentation of the Rosetta [PowerPC](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/PowerPC/) emulation layer revealed that applications written for [Mac OS 8](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-8/) or 9 would not run on x86-based Macs. The Classic Environment remains in the PowerPC version of 10.4; however, x86 versions of OS X do not support the Classic environment.

Mac OS 9 can be emulated by using [SheepShaver](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/SheepShaver/), a [PowerPC](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/PowerPC/) emulator available on multiple operating systems, including Intel-based Macs. However, SheepShaver cannot run Mac OS versions newer than 9.0.4, as there is no support for a memory management unit. The PearPC PowerPC emulator does not support Mac OS 9. QEMU has experimental support for running Mac OS 9 using [PowerPC](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/PowerPC/) G4 emulation.

Any G4 Macs that have a 1 GHz and higher processor and all G5 Macs can not boot Mac OS 9 natively as the "Mac OS ROM" was never updated to allow those Macs, which were developed during the [OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/) era, to directly boot it. In recent years, unofficial patches for Mac OS 9 and the Mac OS ROM have been made to allow unsupported G4 Macs to boot into Mac OS 9 (G5 Macs still can't run Mac OS 9 at all since Mac OS 9 doesn't recognize the G5 processor), though this is not officially supported by Apple.

## Availability

While Mac OS 9 is no longer supported by Apple, retail copies are still available from several Internet businesses at varying prices.

Although now classed as abandonware, as development on it has ended, it is still in use by those who cannot upgrade to [OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/) due to hardware limitations or prefer it to [OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/). Mac OS 9 is also a popular choice for retrocomputing hobbyists. Mac gamers also sometimes revert to Classic (often via emulation) or native OS 9 in order to play games that are not supported on OS X; for example: Bugdom, Nanosaur, Oregon Trail, Civilization II, and the Marathon Trilogy.

## Other uses

Aside from Apple-branded hardware that is still maintained and operated, Mac OS 9 can be operated in other environments such as Windows and Unix.[ For example, the aforementioned [SheepShaver](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/SheepShaver/) software was not designed for use on x86 platforms and required an actual PowerPC processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a hypervisor. Although it provides PowerPC processor support, it can only run up to Mac OS 9.0.4 because it does not emulate a memory management unit.

Some newest G3 and most G4 Macs can only run at least Mac OS 9.1, and some only run at least Mac OS 9.2. This is because the late development of G3 Macs and the mid-development of G4 Macs was during the development of Mac OS 9 and only the versions the G4 Macs support were designed to be compatible with those G4 Macs.

Some newest G4 and all G5 Macs can only run at least Mac OS 9.2, and can only run its compatible versions of Mac OS 9 in OS X's Classic Environment because the "Mac OS ROM" was never updated to allow those Macs, which were developed during the OS X era, to directly boot it (but probably continued to run in userspace, with the restriction that it would only run at least Mac OS 9.2, so it was still supported in the Classic Environment).
