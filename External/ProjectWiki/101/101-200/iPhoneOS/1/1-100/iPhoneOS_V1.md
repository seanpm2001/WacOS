_[iPhoneOS 1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-1/), the initial release of iPhoneOS_

( **Preceeded by:** [NewtonOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NewtonOS/) | **Succeeded by:** [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) & [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/)

iPhoneOS is the predecessor to [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) Apples operating system for iPhones, iPads, and iPods. iPhoneOS was a revolutionary feat for Apple, with the release of the [iPhone 2G](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhone-2G/) by Apple in 2007, which became iconic to Apple.

Initially, iPhoneOS wasn't called anything, but in 2010, it got its name. It was succeeded by [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/)

iPhoneOS introduced the touch screen interface, gestures, and more to the Apple platform. It was originally a very lightweight system designed to run on the micro-architecture of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.
