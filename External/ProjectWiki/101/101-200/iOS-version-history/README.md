# iOS version history

( **Predecessor:** [iPhoneOS version history](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-version-history/) | **Successor:** [iPadOS Version history](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-Version-history/) )

**As of 2021 September 28th, iOS 12 and later are still supported and are receiving updates. The data here will need to be updated in the future.**

The version history of the mobile operating system [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/), developed by Apple Inc., began with the release of [iPhone OS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS/) for the original [iPhone](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhone-2G/) on June 29, [2007](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2007/). Since its initial release, it has been used as the operating system for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and HomePod, seeing continuous development since then, resulting in new major releases of the software typically being announced at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference and later released in September, coinciding with the release of new iPhone models. Starting with the [13.0](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-13/) release, the operating system for iPad was split off as [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/). The latest stable version of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) and [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/), 15.0, was released on September 20, [2021](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2021/). The latest beta version of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) and [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/), 15.1 beta, was released on September 21, [2021](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2021/).

Updates can be done over-the-air through settings (since [iOS 5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-5/)), or via the iTunes or Finder applications.

## Overview

June 2007 saw the official release of what eventually became [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) – concurrently with the first [iPhone](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhone-2G/). [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) did not have an official name until the official release of the iPhone software development kit (iPhone SDK) on March 6, [2008](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2008/). Before then, Apple marketing simply stated that iPhone ran a version of [Mac OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-X-10-0-Cheetah/) made specifically for the iPhone. When [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) was introduced, it was named iPhone OS. It was officially renamed [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) on June 7, [2010](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2010/), with the announcement and introduction of the first-generation iPad. The introduction of what would later become the iPad line, and the existence of iPod Touch, meant the iPhone was no longer the only device to run the mobile operating system. [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/) was the first major [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) release that reflected the name change. Apple licensed the "iOS" trademark from Cisco Systems.

Apple concurrently provides the same version of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) for the comparable model of iPhone and iPod Touch, usually devices released in the same calendar year. iPhone users receive all software updates for free, while iPod Touch users paid for the 2.0 and 3.0 major software updates. As of [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/), Apple no longer charges for iPod Touch updates.

As of [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/), four versions of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) were not publicly released, with the version numbers of three of them changed during development. [iPhone OS 1.2](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-version-history/) was replaced by a 2.0 version number after the first beta; the second beta was named 2.0 beta 2 instead of 1.2 beta 2. The second was iOS 4.2, replaced with 4.2.1 due to a Wi-Fi bug in 4.2 beta 3, causing Apple to release 2 golden masters (4.2 GM and 4.2.1 GM). The third was iOS 13.4.5, which was renamed to iOS 13.5 when Beta 3 was released, with the introduction of the Exposure Notification API, which required an SDK update. Similarly, iOS 13.5.5 was renamed to iOS 13.6 in beta 2, with the introduction of new features for the Health app.

One version of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) was pulled back by Apple after being released (iOS 8.0.1) due to issues with cellular service and Touch ID on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus units.

Apple announced [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/) in March [2010](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2010/) and it was released to the public on June 21, [2010](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2010/), alongside the iPhone 4. With this release, Apple dropped support for the original iPhone and the 1st generation iPod Touch, which is the first time Apple had dropped support for any device in an [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) release. The iPhone 3G and the 2nd generation iPod Touch were capable of running [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/), but had limited features. For example, both devices lack multitasking capabilities and the ability to set a home screen wallpaper. However, [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Ios-4/) was the first major release that iPod Touch users did not have to pay any money for. The release of iOS 4.2.1 brought compatibility to the original iPad and was the final release supported on the iPhone 3G and 2nd generation iPod Touch due to major performance issues. The release of iOS 4.3 brought iPad 2 compatibility.

Apple announced [iOS 7](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-7/) on June 10, [2013](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2013/), at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 18, [2013](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2013/), alongside the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S. With this release, Apple dropped support for the iPhone 3GS due to hardware limitations and the iPod Touch (4th generation) due to performance issues. [iOS 7](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-7/) has limited support on the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4 since they do not support Siri. However, other devices from the iPhone 4S onwards, iPod Touch (5th generation) onwards, the iPad (3rd generation) onwards, and the iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards were fully supported. The release of iOS 7.0.3 brought support for the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2. iOS 7.1.2 was the final release on the iPhone 4.

Apple announced [iOS 8](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-8/) on June 2, [2014](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2014/), at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 17, [2014](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2014/), alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. With this release, Apple dropped support for one device, the iPhone 4. [iOS 8](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-8/) has limited support on the iPad 2, iPhone 4S, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), and the iPod Touch (5th generation), as Apple received widespread complaints of extremely poor/slow performance from owners of these devices. All other devices from the iPhone 5 onwards, iPod Touch (6th generation) onwards, the iPad (4th generation) onwards, and the iPad Mini 2 onwards were fully supported. The release of iOS 8.1 brought support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3, and the release of iOS 8.4 brought support for the iPod Touch (6th generation). iOS 8.3 was the first version of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) to have public beta testing available, where users could test the beta for upcoming releases of iOS and send feedback to Apple about bugs or issues. The final version of [iOS 8](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-8/) was iOS 8.4.1.

Apple announced [iOS 9](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-9/) on June 8, [2015](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2015/), at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 16, [2015](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2015/), alongside the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus and iPad Mini 4. With this release, Apple did not drop support for any [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) devices. Therefore, [iOS 9](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-9/) was supported on the iPhone 4S onwards, iPod Touch (5th generation) onwards, the iPad 2 onwards, and the iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards. However, [iOS 9](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-9/) has limited support on devices with an Apple A5 or A5X processor: the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), and iPod Touch (5th generation). This release made the iPad 2 the first device to support six major releases of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/), supporting [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/) thru [iOS 9](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-9/). Despite Apple's promise of better performance on these devices, there were still widespread complaints that the issue had not been fixed. iOS 9.3.5 is the final release on the iPod Touch (5th generation), the Wi-Fi-only iPad 2, the Wi-Fi-only iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi-only iPad Mini (1st generation). iOS 9.3.6 is the final release on the iPhone 4S, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad 2, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad Mini (1st generation).

Fixes three zero-day vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were chained together by the NSO Group into the Trident exploit chain. Trident is composed of CVE-2016–4657, CVE-2016–4655 and CVE-2016–4656 and uses them in that order. First, Trident's first stage uses CVE-2016–4657 to exploit WebKit, iOS's built-in web browser engine, via malicious JavaScript to cause WebKit to execute arbitrary Trident's second stage malware. Trident's second stage then downloads the Pegasus spyware package, uses CVE-2016–4655 to locate the kernel, and uses CVE-2016–4656 to disable signature verification in order to allow unsigned code like Pegasus to execute. The second stage malware then uses the previously discovered location of the kernel to install and load Pegasus with kernel privileges, allowing the attacker to steal all data on the phone and spy on the victim's conversations live.

Apple announced [iOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-13/) on June 3, [2019](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2019/), at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 19, [2019](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2019/) alongside the iPhone 11 series (11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max). The principal features include dark mode and Memoji support for A9+ devices. The NFC framework now supports reading several types of contactless smartcards and tags. The iPad gains several tablet-oriented features, and its operating system has been rebranded as [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/); [iPadOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-13/) was announced at the 2019 WWDC as well.

Only available on iPhone.

Version Build Release date Features

13.0 17A577 September 19, 2019; 2 years ago 

Initial release on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro / iPhone 11 Pro Max

The OS on the iPad 2017, 2018, Air 2, Air 3, Mini 4, Mini 5, and Pro line has been renamed to iPadOS. It is similar to iOS 13, but has some features exclusively for iPad.

Dark Mode

When enabled, the UI, native apps, and supported third-party apps undergo a basic light-on-dark color scheme, and the iOS 13 wallpapers have a darker color scheme. The user can also set a schedule for what time Dark Mode comes on, and what time Light Mode comes back on.

Siri

Siri's voice is now done by software called "Neural TTS" instead of human voice clips, making Siri sound much more natural.

Siri can now play audio, including music, podcasts, audio books, and radio, with third-party apps.

There is now an option for an Indian-English voice.

Siri now offers personalized suggestions in Apple Podcasts, Safari, and Maps. Siri can also now detect reminders in messages and events in third-party apps.

Siri can now tune into radio shows on command.

Keyboard

The QuickType keyboard now includes QuickPath, which allows the user to type in a word by sliding a finger between the letters without moving it up. QuickPath supports English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.

Swiping or tapping to type works interchangeably, even mid-sentence.

Alternate word options now appear in the predictive bar.

Dictation will automatically detect what language a user is speaking. This language will be chosen from up to four keyboard languages enabled on the device.

Camera

After taking a picture in Portrait Mode, the user can adjust the position and intensity of each Portrait lighting effect.

A new Portrait Lighting effect, called High-Key Mono, "creates a beautiful, classic look with a monochromatic subject on a white background."

Portrait Segmentation API now has skin, hair, and teeth segmentation.

All-new Camera app on the iPhone 11 series

App Store

Apple Arcade: A new subscription service with over 100 new games, with no ads or additional purchases.

The Updates tab found in iOS 12 and earlier has been removed and merged into the Account bottom sheet.

The App Store now has support for Arabic and Hebrew in stories, collections and lists, product pages, and searches.

Apps with large sizes (especially games) can now be downloaded over a cellular connection, but the user will be warned if the file size exceeds a certain threshold.

Maps

The map itself has been redone from the ground up. According to Apple, it features "significantly improved and more realistic details" for areas like roads, beaches, parks, buildings, and more.

The user can now explore the area they are going to before they arrive with a 3D, 360-degree experience.

Collections of favorite locations can be built and shared with others.

The user can now make a list of places they visit often to access them quickly.

A feature called Junction View helps drivers in China eliminate wrong turns and directional misses by lining them up in the correct lane before they need to turn or enter an elevated road.

The process of submitting customer feedback has been redesigned to be faster.

Siri's navigation uses more natural language. For example, instead of saying "in x feet turn left," it says "turn left at the next traffic light". Navigation is also more accurate.

The user can now see departure times live, the location of their bus or train on its route, and a more detailed schedule of transit stops.

Flight details now include info about a terminal, gate locations, departure times, and more.

Place cards have more improved info, such as Today @ Apple sessions at Apple Store locations, and movie theater time listings.

MapKit now has vector overlays, point-of-interest filtering, camera zoom and pan limits, and Dark Mode support.

CarPlay now has easier route planning, search, and navigation. It also includes Junction View (China only), Favorites, and Collections.

Apple Music

Introduces support for lyrics synchronized to the song a user is currently listening to. Not all songs support this feature.

Redesigns the Now Playing bottom sheet, moving the Up Next queue to a dedicated action, while moving the Shuffle and Repeat actions to the Up Next view.

Adds over 100,000 live radio stations to the service.

Performance

Apps can now launch up to twice as fast as on iOS 12.

Unlocking the iPhone X, XS, XS Max, and XR using Face ID is up to 30% faster compared to iOS 12.

Apps from the App Store are packaged in a new way, making them as small as half the size compared to iOS 12, which makes them download faster and take up less storage.

App updates are on average 60% smaller compared to iOS 12, allowing for faster downloads.

Other Changes

Introduces support for pinch to zoom in the Voice Memos app when editing voice recordings.

Adds support for the DualShock 4 and Xbox One wireless controllers.

Apple announced [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/) and [iPadOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/) on June 22, [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/) at its annual WWDC [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/) event, with a developer beta released on the same day and a public beta released on July 9, [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/). [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/) and [iPadOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/) were released on September 16, [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/), alongside the iPad (8th Generation) and iPad Air (4th Generation). All devices that supported [iOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-13/) also support [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/). This makes the iPad Air 2 the first device to support seven versions of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) and [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/), from [iOS 8](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-8/) to [iPadOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/). Some new features introduced in [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/) and [iPadOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/) include redesigned widgets that can now be placed directly on the homescreen (only for [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/)), along with the App Library, which automatically categorizes apps into one page, Picture in Picture in iPhone and iPod touch, and the CarKey technology to unlock and start a car with NFC. [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) and [iPadOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/) also allow the user to have incoming calls shown in banners rather than taking up the whole screen (the latter view is still available as an optional function).

The release of [iPadOS 14.0](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/) brought support for the 8th generation iPad and the 4th generation iPad Air and the release of iOS 14.1 brought support for the iPhone 12, the iPhone 12 Mini and the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max. [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/) and [iPadOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-14/) have limited support on devices with A8, A8X, A9, A9X, and A10 Fusion chips, whereas devices with A10X Fusion and A11 Bionic chip have almost full support, and devices with A12 Bionic chip and later have full support.
