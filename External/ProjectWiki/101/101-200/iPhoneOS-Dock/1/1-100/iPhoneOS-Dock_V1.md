# iPhoneOS Dock

The original versions of [iPhoneOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-Version-History) had a dock, similar to MacOS, although you could not change the order of the dock or what apps were on the dock. The same 4 apps were on the dock on all [3 of the major versions of iPhoneOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-Version-History). The dock did not change unitl [iOS 5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS_5/)

Unlike MacOS, the dock cannot be expanded (the same goes for all versions of iOS as of [iOS 15](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-15/)

The dock has a metal texture to it on for all 3 major releases of iPhoneOS. It was changed to a polished glass dock on [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS_4/) to [iOS 6](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS_6/). Following [iOS 7](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-7/) it was changed to a flat dock.
