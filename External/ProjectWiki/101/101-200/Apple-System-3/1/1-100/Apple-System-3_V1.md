( **Predecessor:** [System 2 (1985)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Apple-System-2/) | **Successor:** [System 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Apple-System-4/) )

Apple System 3 is the third version of the then-to-be classic MacOS series of operating systems produced by Apple Inc.

System 3.0 (Finder 5.1) was introduced with the Macintosh Plus, officially implementing HFS, 800K startup drives, support for several new technologies including SCSI and AppleShare, and Trash "bulging" (i.e., when the Trash contains files, it gains a bulged appearance).
