_iOS 4, the initial release of iOS_

( **Preceeded by:** [iPhoneOS 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-3/) | **Current version** `15.1 beta (19B5042h) (September 21, 2021)` )

iOS is a series of mobile operating systems by Apple Inc. for their lines of iPods, iPhones, and iPads. It succeeded [iPhoneOS 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-3/) as it was an operating system for more than just iPhones. iOS is proprietary, and is based on [Darwin](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Darwin/) BSD ([Openstep](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OPENSTEP/)) the same base [MacOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS/) was written on prior to the year 2000.

iOS is a touch screen, gesture based mobile operating system. It is designed only for Apple devices, and as of 2021, it has not been emulated in a virtual machine (as far as I know)

In 2019, iOS was forked to create [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/) to work on iPods, starting with [iPadOS 13](iPadOS-13/) with [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-13/)
