# About WacOS DE (Desktop Environment)

_Not to be confused with [Skeuowie](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Skeuowie/)_

WacOS is meant to imitate MacOS and iOS in design and offer Apple functionality, but on open-source Linux-based machines. The desktop environment was originally one of the biggest features, but support for IPA and DMG, etc. became important as well to distinguish WacOS from being a desktop environment, rather than a operating system.

It is not recommended to switch desktop environments for this distribution, as that is taking away half of its purpose. However, the option is available, and you can easily switch back.

By default, WacOS will use a heavily modified version of my [Skeuowie desktop environment](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie/tree/main) but will offer other desktop environments as a backup, and as a choice.

Currently, the following 4 Desktop Environments are supported:

[Skeuowie with WacOS theme](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie/tree/main) (Planned default)

[KDE Plasma 5](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop) (Backup 1) - Currently the default until Skeuowie is more developed

[GNOME 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_3) (Extra 1)

[GNOME 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_2) (Extra 2)
