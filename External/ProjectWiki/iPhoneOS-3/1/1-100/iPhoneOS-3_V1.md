iPhoneOS 3 was the third version of the iOS series of operating systems. Its name didn't change from iOS until iOS 4.

iPhoneOS 3 was released on June 17th 2009 and ran on the original iPhone (the iPhone 2G) along with the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS, the iPod Touch (1st generation, 2nd generation, and 3rd generation) along with the first generation iPad.

iPhoneOS 3 added support for system wide cut, copy, and paste through gestures and a dialog bubble. It also introduced Spotlight, a search indexing feature designed to help users locate specific information on their device, such as contacts, email messages or apps. The home screen was expanded to let users add up to 11 pages, showcasing a total of 180 apps. The Messages app received support for MMS, while the Camera app received support for video recording on the iPhone 3GS, and a new "Voice Memos" app let users record their voice. 

It was succeeded by [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-4/) on June 21st 2020. It received several updates before being discontinued.

As like other Apple operating systems, iPhoneOS 3 is proprietary software.
