iOS 4 is a mobile operating system created by Apple Inc and was released on 2010 June 24th. It is the 4th major release of iOS, and the first release to be named iOS, the previous releases were known as [iPhoneOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-Version-History) It succeeded [iPhoneOS 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-3) and it was succeeded by [iOS 5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS_5) on 2011 October 12th.

## Feature changes

iOS 4 introduced folders on the home screen, significantly increasing the number of apps that can be displayed.

Support for custom wallpapers was also added, although limited to newer devices due to animation performance requirements.

The operating system also added a multitasking feature, letting apps dealing with Internet calling, location and audio playback function in the background, whereas a similar but more restricted "Fast App Switching" technology enabled any app to be left inactive in the background while users switch to other apps.

iOS 4 also added a system-wide spell checking feature, enabled iBooks on iPhone, unified the Mail inbox to combine content from different email providers, and introduced both Game Center for social gaming and FaceTime for video calling.

The iOS 4 update introduced performance and battery problems on iPhone 3G devices, with Apple investigating the matter and promising then-upcoming updates.

However, the company became the subject of a lawsuit from an unsatisfied customer over the issues. Around the same time, the release of iPhone 4 and its subsequent antenna problems made Apple focus on unsuccessfully attempting to patch the issues with software updates.
