## Initial founding

Apple was founded in Steve Jobs house in a bedroom. Although commonly thought that it was started in the garage, Steve Jobs said that this was a misconception, although some operations did move to the garage as the bedroom became crowded.

I am not sure about where the rest of the campus was between 1977 and 1993.

## One Infinite Loop

Apples Campus for 24 years was located in Cupertino California, at One Infinite Loop between 1993 and 2017, when it was moved to Apple Park.
