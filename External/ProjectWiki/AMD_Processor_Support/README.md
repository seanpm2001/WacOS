## About

AMD is a massive computer manufacturer in the US. They are well known for their computer processors of various qualities and powers.

AMD was given a chance as a company, as Intel originally had a monopoly on processor manufacturing. AMD is their main competitor, but Intel needs AMD to survive, or else anti-trust lawsuits will occur.

All versions of all AMD processors are planned to be supported.
