# Kernel

## Overview

WacOS uses the Linux kernel by default, but the XNU kernel is a secondary option.

## Linux

WacOS currently used version 5.4 of the Linux Kernel by default (the version hasn't been upgraded in a while, the project is not even close to functional yet anyways)

### XNU

XNU (XNUs Not UNIX) is an alternative kernel that can be used in this project. XNU is the kernel used in MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, and TvOS, and is recommended only for true Apple fans. Apple uses a modified version of the XNU kernel called Darwin, which is BSD-based.
