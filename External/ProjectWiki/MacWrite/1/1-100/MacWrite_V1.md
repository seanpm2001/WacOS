MacWrite is a word processor software piece for the first version of Mac OS [(System 1)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/System-1/) up to [Mac OS 7](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Mac-OS-7/) it was created in response to the [Macintosh 128K](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Macintosh-128K/) being a brand new operating system with a Graphical User Interface that had no apps to go with it, as the original Macintosh didn't come with a programming language or any other apps. 

MacWrite and [MacPaint](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacPaint/) were the first 2 killer applications for Classic Mac OS. The project was spun off to the company [Claris](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Claris/) and as the Mac got new software, and other competitors were coming along, MacWrite had very few updates, and with the exceeding popularity of Microsoft Word 4.0 and later versions, development of MacWrite ceased around [1995](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/1995/) and the project was discontinued in [1998](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/1998/)
