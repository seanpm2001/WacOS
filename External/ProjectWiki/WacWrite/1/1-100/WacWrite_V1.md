[Repository (seanpm2001/WacWrite/)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacWrite/) or [Mirror (in WacOS)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/master/Programs/Legacy/WacWrite/)

WacWrite is a word processor software piece for legacy versions of WacOS (8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit) that imitates [MacWrite](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacWrite/) in style and functionality. It is written in C and Assembly.

The classic mode (legacy) aims to imitate the original software. It supports all the same features MacWrite does, but only works on 8 and 16 bit versions. It is compatible with 4 languages (English, French, German, and Spanish) and can be used as a very simple word processor.

The advanced mode (wacky) aims to have the same features as the legacy mode and still be for legacy WacOS, but also support 32 bit architectures, a plethora of basic features and advanced customizations, include extended language support (Esperanto, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, South Korean, Czech, Portuguese, Finnish, Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Swedish, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Uyghur, and Classical Mongolian (Although no Telugu support to match MacOS and the Telugu bug)

Emojis still aren't supported, as they require a more modern system. This version can also export in the ODT, UOT, and PDF formats.

WacWrite does not have its own icon yet, so it still uses the icon of MacWrite
