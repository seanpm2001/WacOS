Internet Explorer for MacOS was initially released on April 23rd 1996 as a partnership between Microsoft and Apple. It was a specialized version of the Internet Explorer web browser that worked specifically for Mac OS.

On 2003 June 13th, Microsoft announced the end of support for Internet Explorer for Mac, and urged MacOS users to switch to a different browser. Safari was released on January 7th 2003, and was the recommended alternative.

Internet Explorer for Mac worked on MacOS System 7.0.1 to Mac OS X 10.6.8. It does not work on older or newer versions.

Safari was initially released on January 3rd 2003 as Apples own browser, and also to replace [Internet Explorer for Mac](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac) as Microsoft had a deal with Apple at the time to bundle special versions of Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office into the MacOS operating system. Today, only Microsoft Office for Mac exists, and it goes by a different name.

For WacOS, an alternative is being decided on, I don't have very many plans for it yet.

Internet Explorer for Mac has 1 common Easter Egg, where if you type `about:tasman` a modified version of the [acid1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/acid1) test would appear, proving compliance for the acid1 test, and also showcasing the developers names.
