iPhoneOS 2 was the second version of the iOS series of operating systems. Its name didn't change from iOS until iOS 4.

iPhoneOS 2 was released on July 11th 2008 and ran on the original iPhone (the iPhone 2G) along with the iPhone 3G, and iPod Touch (1st generation and 2nd generation)

iPhoneOS 2 added support for the Apple App store, which allowed for the download of 3rd party applications. It was received well, although more polishing was expected.

It was succeeded by [iPhone OS 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-3/) on July 11th 2008. It received a few updates before being discontinued.

As like other Apple operating systems, iPhoneOS 2 is proprietary software.
