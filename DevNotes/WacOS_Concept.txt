Concept: WacOS (August 27th 2019)

Thought of by Sean on August 27th 2019

WacOS (Linux)
Linux that has most of the functionality of MacOS 10.9 but without proprietary features
A desktop environment menu where you can change the theme to make the OS look like
System 1
System 2
System 3
System 4
System 5
System 6
MacOS 7
MacOS 8
MacOS 9
MacOS X Beta
MacOS X 10.0
MacOS X 10.1
MacOS X 10.2
MacOS X 10.3
MacOS X 10.4
MacOS X 10.5
MacOS X 10.6
MacOS X 10.7
OS X 10.8
OS X 10.9
Those are all the good environments
Below it are the crappy solid color ones which might not be implementable for a while due to Apples copyright
MacOS 10.10
MacOS 10.11
MacOS 10.12
MacOS 10.13
MacOS 10.14
MacOS 10.15

More info
WacOS will be a Linux based operating system that acts like MacOS, but with improved functionality, being more open, and having new and other features
its naming (LacOS didn't seem like a good name, as it sounds like "Lack OS" which shouldn't be associated with a Linux distribution, and it was 5:33 in the morning, so I don't know where the W came from. Just note the W does not stand for Windows
Pronounced like: Wack O S or Walk O S or however you would like to pronounce it
It can act as a MacOS port that isn't developed by apple, and doesn't need an expensive computer to run with. Linux users constantly go through phases of different operating systems themes, a lot of Linux users go through a MacOS phase, I haven't yet, but I could in the future
It will be highly functional, and will be written in C for the core, and Python for the system, as I want to continue to spread Python, it is a great programming language, it is simple to write, and very powerful
Some features include a desktop interface changer that can make the distro function like any version of MacOS, without the restrictiveness, and proprietary functionality
iOS and MacOS programs from System 1 to the latest version, and iPhone OS 1 to the latest version will be supported
The system will be at minimum 64 bit, but will contain 32 bit, 16 bit, 8 bit, and 4 bit libraries (I also plan on having 128 bit libraries)
The system MUST be light, with no more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM being used by the system itself at any time. On Idle, it should use no more than 500 Megabytes of RAM.
It must be compatible with virtualization software like VirtualBox, Qemu, VMWare, etc. If anyone wants to go through and make it compatible with hyper-V, it is completely optional
If this is to be completed, it must be better than Windows and MacOS
