_The above image is an example of the acid1 test being completed successfully._

Acid1 is a test page for web browsers developed in 1998 October as a way to test and measure interoperability between web browsers. It was superseded by the [acid2](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/acid2) test in 2005, April 13th

## As an Easter Egg

Internet Explorer for Mac has 1 common Easter Egg, where if you type `about:tasman` a modified version of the [acid1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/acid1) test would appear, proving compliance for the acid1 test, and also showcasing the developers names.


## Sources

More sources coming soon, although right now, most information comes from the acid1 and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X Wikipedia articles, along with past knowledge.
