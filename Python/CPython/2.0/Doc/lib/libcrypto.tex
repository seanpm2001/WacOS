The modules described in this chapter implement various algorithms of
a cryptographic nature.  They are available at the discretion of the
installation.  Here's an overview:

Hardcore cypherpunks will probably find the cryptographic modules
written by Andrew Kuchling of further interest; the package adds
built-in modules for DES and IDEA encryption, provides a Python module
for reading and decrypting PGP files, and then some.  These modules
are not distributed with Python but available separately.  See the URL
