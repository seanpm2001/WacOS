\modulesynopsis{Encode and decode files using the MIME
                quoted-printable encoding.}


This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding,
as defined in \rfc{1521}: ``MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
Part One''.  The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where
there are relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding
scheme available via the \refmodule{base64} module is more compact if there
are many such characters, as when sending a graphics file.

\begin{funcdesc}{decode}{input, output}
Decode the contents of the \var{input} file and write the resulting
decoded binary data to the \var{output} file.
\var{input} and \var{output} must either be file objects or objects that
mimic the file object interface. \var{input} will be read until
\code{\var{input}.read()} returns an empty string.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{encode}{input, output, quotetabs}
Encode the contents of the \var{input} file and write the resulting
quoted-printable data to the \var{output} file.
\var{input} and \var{output} must either be file objects or objects that
mimic the file object interface. \var{input} will be read until
\code{\var{input}.read()} returns an empty string.
