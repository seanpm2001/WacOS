The SAX API defines four kinds of handlers: content handlers, DTD
handlers, error handlers, and entity resolvers. Applications normally
only need to implement those interfaces whose events they are
interested in; they can implement the interfaces in a single object or
in multiple objects. Handler implementations should inherit from the
base classes provided in the module \module{xml.sax}, so that all
methods get default implementations.

\begin{classdesc}{ContentHandler}{}
  This is the main callback interface in SAX, and the one most
  important to applications. The order of events in this interface
  mirrors the order of the information in the document.
\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{DTDHandler}{}
  Handle DTD events.

  This interface specifies only those DTD events required for basic
  parsing (unparsed entities and attributes).
\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{EntityResolver}{}
 Basic interface for resolving entities. If you create an object
 implementing this interface, then register the object with your
 Parser, the parser will call the method in your object to resolve all
 external entities.
\end{classdesc}

In addition to these classes, \module{xml.sax.handler} provides
symbolic constants for the feature and property names.

\subsection{ContentHandler Objects \label{content-handler-objects}}

Users are expected to subclass \class{ContentHandler} to support their
application.  The following methods are called by the parser on the
appropriate events in the input document:

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{setDocumentLocator}{locator}
  Called by the parser to give the application a locator for locating
  the origin of document events.
  
  SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely required)
  to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply the locator to
  the application by invoking this method before invoking any of the
  other methods in the DocumentHandler interface.
  
  The locator allows the application to determine the end position of
  any document-related event, even if the parser is not reporting an
  error. Typically, the application will use this information for
  reporting its own errors (such as character content that does not
  match an application's business rules). The information returned by
  the locator is probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.
  
  Note that the locator will return correct information only during
  the invocation of the events in this interface. The application
  should not attempt to use it at any other time.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{startDocument}{}
  Receive notification of the beginning of a document.
        
  The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, before any other
  methods in this interface or in DTDHandler (except for
  \method{setDocumentLocator()}).
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{endDocument}{}
  Receive notification of the end of a document.
        
  The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, and it will be the
  last method invoked during the parse. The parser shall not invoke
  this method until it has either abandoned parsing (because of an
  unrecoverable error) or reached the end of input.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{startPrefixMapping}{prefix, uri}
  Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.
        
  The information from this event is not necessary for normal
  Namespace processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically replace
  prefixes for element and attribute names when the
  \code{http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces} feature is true (the
  default).

%% XXX This is not really the default, is it? MvL
  
  There are cases, however, when applications need to use prefixes in
  character data or in attribute values, where they cannot safely be
  expanded automatically; the start/endPrefixMapping event supplies
  the information to the application to expand prefixes in those
  contexts itself, if necessary.
  
  Note that start/endPrefixMapping events are not guaranteed to be
  properly nested relative to each-other: all
  \method{startPrefixMapping()} events will occur before the
  corresponding startElement event, and all \method{endPrefixMapping()}
  events will occur after the corresponding \method{endElement()} event,
  but their order is not guaranteed.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{endPrefixMapping}{prefix}
  End the scope of a prefix-URI mapping.
        
  See \method{startPrefixMapping()} for details. This event will always
  occur after the corresponding endElement event, but the order of
  endPrefixMapping events is not otherwise guaranteed.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{startElement}{name, attrs}
  Signals the start of an element in non-namespace mode.

  The \var{name} parameter contains the raw XML 1.0 name of the
  element type as a string and the \var{attrs} parameter holds an
  instance of the \class{Attributes} class containing the attributes
  of the element.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{endElement}{name}
  Signals the end of an element in non-namespace mode.

  The \var{name} parameter contains the name of the element type, just
  as with the startElement event.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{startElementNS}{name, qname, attrs}
  Signals the start of an element in namespace mode.

  The \var{name} parameter contains the name of the element type as a
  (uri, localname) tuple, the \var{qname} parameter the raw XML 1.0
  name used in the source document, and the \var{attrs} parameter
  holds an instance of the \class{AttributesNS} class containing the
  attributes of the element.

  Parsers may set the \var{qname} parameter to \code{None}, unless the
  \code{http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes} feature is
  activated.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{endElementNS}{name, qname}
  Signals the end of an element in namespace mode.

  The \var{name} parameter contains the name of the element type, just
  as with the startElementNS event, likewise the \var{qname} parameter.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{characters}{content}
  Receive notification of character data.
        
  The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of character
  data. SAX parsers may return all contiguous character data in a
  single chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however, all
  of the characters in any single event must come from the same
  external entity so that the Locator provides useful information.

  \var{content} may be a Unicode string or a byte string; the
  \code{expat} reader module produces always Unicode strings.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{ignorableWhitespace}{}
  Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content.
        
  Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk
  of ignorable whitespace (see the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation,
  section 2.10): non-validating parsers may also use this method
  if they are capable of parsing and using content models.
  
  SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single
  chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however, all
  of the characters in any single event must come from the same
  external entity, so that the Locator provides useful
  information.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{processingInstruction}{target, data}
  Receive notification of a processing instruction.
        
  The Parser will invoke this method once for each processing
  instruction found: note that processing instructions may occur
  before or after the main document element.

  A SAX parser should never report an XML declaration (XML 1.0,
  section 2.8) or a text declaration (XML 1.0, section 4.3.1) using
  this method.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[ContentHandler]{skippedEntity}{name}
  Receive notification of a skipped entity.
        
  The Parser will invoke this method once for each entity
  skipped. Non-validating processors may skip entities if they have
  not seen the declarations (because, for example, the entity was
  declared in an external DTD subset). All processors may skip
  external entities, depending on the values of the
  \code{http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities} and the
  \code{http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities}
  properties.
\end{methoddesc}


\subsection{DTDHandler Objects \label{dtd-handler-objects}}

\class{DTDHandler} instances provide the following methods:

\begin{methoddesc}[DTDHandler]{notationDecl}{name, publicId, systemId}
  Handle a notation declaration event.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[DTDHandler]{unparsedEntityDecl}{name, publicId,
                                                   systemId, ndata}
  Handle an unparsed entity declaration event.
\end{methoddesc}


\subsection{EntityResolver Objects \label{entity-resolver-objects}}

\begin{methoddesc}[EntityResolver]{resolveEntity}{publicId, systemId}
  Resolve the system identifier of an entity and return either the
  system identifier to read from as a string, or an InputSource to
  read from. The default implementation returns \var{systemId}.
\end{methoddesc}
