These demos run only on SGI machines and require the 'gl' built-in module.
The demonstrate the abilities of SGI's GL library as well as the ease of
GL programming in Python.  Most demos require the Z-buffer (aka
24-bitplane) option.  Press ESC to get out of any of them.

backface.py	Demonstrates the 'backface' GL function.

kites.py	Show 3 flying kites.  Demonstrates the rendering speed
		obtainable by Python programs.

kunst.py	Cute demo showing a ball suspended on four cables in
		the central room of the CWI building.  You can specify
		three functions Fx(t), Fy(t), Fz(t) which define the
		movement of the ball.  Try something like sin(t),
		cos(t), sin(2*t).

mclock.py	A colorful clock with more options than you can
		remember.  Works on 8-bit machines, but allows more
		colors on 24-bit machines.  See mclock.doc for more
		info.

mixing.py	Demonstrates the effect of color mixing: through
		frequent color switching it gives the effect of white
		light.

nurbs.py	A simple demonstration of the 'nurbs' GL functions.
		Press left mouse button to toggle surface trimming.

zrgb.py		Displays a 3-D Gouraud-shaded figure which can be moved
		around with the mouse.

glstdwin/	This is quite different: a partial STDWIN emulation
		using GL!  Requires only small changes to Python
		programs that use STDWIN.  Some features not yet
		implemented, e.g., scroll bars.
