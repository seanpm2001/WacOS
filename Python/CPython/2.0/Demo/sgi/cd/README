These are some programs to work with the SCSI CD-ROM player's audio
interface (see cdaudio(3) in IRIX 4.0 or higher; tested only on 4.0.2).

See also the SGI-specific standard module 'readcd', documented as
"readcd.lib" in the library.

cdwin.py	A trivial window interface to play a CD over the CD
		player's audio jack.  More functionality is left as an
		excersice to the reader.  Needs module stdwin.

listcd.py	List the table-of-contents of a CD (data CDs will
		appear as a single track).

playcd.py	Read audio data from the CD and play it over the
		Indigo's built-in speker or audio jack.  Needs module al.

sendcd.py	Read audio data from the CD and send it as UDP packets
		over the network (to recvcd.py).

recvcd.py	Receive UDP packets containing CD audio data (from
		sendcd.py) and play them over the Indigo's built-in
		speaker or audio jack.  Needs module al.  (Doesn't
		actually use module cd.)

cdaiff.py	Dump CD audio to disk in AIFF format.

Note that to read *data* CD-ROMs you must open /dev/rdsk/dks0d4s7 or
some such special file...
