This directory show how to embed the Python interpreter in your own
application.  The file demo.c shows you all that is needed in your C
code.

To build it, you may have to edit the Makefile:

1) set blddir to the directory where you built Python, if it isn't in
the source directory (../..)

2) change the variables that together define the list of libraries
(MODLIBS, LIBS, SYSLIBS) to link with, to match their definitions in
$(blddir)/Modules/Makefile
