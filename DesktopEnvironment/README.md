# About WacOS DE (Desktop Environment)

WacOS is meant to imitate MacOS and iOS in design and offer Apple functionality, but on open-source Linux-based machines. The desktop environment was originally one of the biggest features, but support for IPA and DMG, etc. became important as well to distinguish WacOS from being a desktop environment, rather than a operating system.

By default, WacOS will use a heavily modified version of my [Skeuowie desktop environment](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie/tree/main) but will offer other desktop environments as a backup, and as a choice.

Currently, the following 5 Desktop Environments are supported:
