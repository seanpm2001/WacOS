# About WacOS DE (Desktop Environment)

WacOS is meant to imitate MacOS and iOS in design and offer Apple functionality, but on open-source Linux-based machines. The desktop environment was originally one of the biggest features, but support for IPA and DMG, etc. became important as well to distinguish WacOS from being a desktop environment, rather than a operating system.

By default, WacOS will use a heavily modified version of my [Skeuowie desktop environment](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie/tree/main) but will offer other desktop environments as a backup, and as a choice.

Currently, the following 5 Desktop Environments are supported:

## Notes

It used to be not recommended to switch desktop environments for this distribution, as "that is taking away half of its purpose" however, WacOS is much more mature now, and it can differentiate itself from being just a UI shell.

KDE is currently a fallback desktop environment, but it will always be supported by this project, even if the KDE foundation ceases to exist (although only older WacOS installs will have it if this happens)

GNOME 3 and 2 are fallback desktop environments like KDE, but are planned to always be supported, even if the GNOME foundation ceases to exist (although only older WacOS installs will have it if this happens)

Support for GNOME 40 and later is not yet available.

Support for XCFE, LXDE, LXQT, CINNAMON, and others is currently being decided on.

## Under construction

A new table is under construction. I don't have enough time to finish it right now, so here is the unfinished table:
