# OnESTEP

OneSTEP (stylized as OnESTEP to be similar to NeXTSTEP) is an open source environment for a NeXTSTEP/OpenSTEP like system. There are currently many projects that offer a similar environment, but not the base system. I also feel like some improvements could be made.

## Recommended

I recommend the following environments whle OnESTEP is under construction:

[`GNUSTEP`](http://gnustep.org/) | [GitHub organization](https://github.com/gnustep/) - Made by [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) and its community

[`NeXTSPACE`](https://trunkmaster.github.io/) | [GitHub repository](https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace) - Made by Ukrainian developer [Trunkmaster](https://github.com/Trunkmaster) and the GitHub community

- Currently only works on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based distributions, such as Fedora, Red Hat Enterpise Linux, and CentOS. Does not currently work on other Linux distributions.

- Someone made an ISO installer for this project. It can be found [here (arm77/nextspace-iso-installer)](https://github.com/armm77/nextspace-iso-installer/)

Both of these projects come really close to the full NeXTSTEP experience, I can't decide which one is better at it, as they both do a really good job.
