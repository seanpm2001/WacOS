_Not to be confused with [OpenCyberdog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OpenCyberdog)_

Cyberdog was a OpenDoc-based web browser application suite developed by Apple in the late 1990s. It was discontinued, as it wasn't successful, and Apple was losing significant amounts of money at the time (they almost went out of business. but then Bill Gates donated US$150,000,000 to Apple via stocks in 1997, and Apple continued to this day) [[1]](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-what-happened-when-microsoft-saved-apple.html)

Upon terminating the project, Steve Jobs said that they "put a bullet through cyberdogs head"

Cyberdog was named after the New Yorker comic with the caption `"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog"`

## Recreation project

Cyberdog is being recreated as [OpenCyberdog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OpenCyberdo), an open source, low end variant to Cyberdog.
