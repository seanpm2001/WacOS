Workspace Manager now has the Shelf, copies performed in background, black hole is replaced by recycler icon. Terminal.app. Dynamic loading of drivers.

2.1a 		MO disc, CD-ROM 	

2.2 		CD-ROM 	Support for the NeXTstation Turbo

3.0 	September 8, 1992 	CD-ROM 	Project Builder, 3D support with Interactive RenderMan, Pantone colors, PostScript Level 2, Object Linking and Embedding, Distributed Objects, Database Kit, Phone Kit, Indexing Kit, precompiled headers, HFS, AppleTalk, and Novell NetWare.

3.1 	May 25, 1993 	CD-ROM 	First release for the i386 architecture, introducing fat binaries.

3.2 	October 1993 	CD-ROM 	

3.3 	February 1995 	CD-ROM 	Support for the PA-RISC and SPARC architectures added, introducing Quad-fat Binaries. Last and most popular version released under the name NEXTSTEP. Referred to as NEXTSTEP/m68k, NEXTSTEP/Intel, NEXTSTEP/SPARC. NEXTSTEP/PA-RISC

Delivered on 2 CDs: NeXTSTEP CISC and NeXTSTEP RISC. The Developer CD includes libraries for all architectures, so that programs can be cross-compiled on any architecture for all architectures.

4.0 beta 	1996 	CD-ROM 	Very different user interface. Notable as being a precursor of many ideas later introduced in the macOS Dock.

Allegedly dropped due to complaints of having to re-teach users but not for technical reasons (the new UI worked well in the beta).

4.0 	July 1996 	CD-ROM 	Support for the PA-RISC architecture dropped. Support for m68k, i486, and SPARC architectures. Initial Release of OpenStep for Windows.

4.1 	January 1997 	CD-ROM 	Support for m68k, i486, and SPARC architectures, and OpenStep for Windows, under OPENSTEP Enterprise (NT only).

4.2 Pre-release 2 	September 1997 	CD-ROM 	Pre-release 2 circulated to limited number of developers before OpenStep and Apple acquisition.

Apple Rhapsody 	August 31, 1997 - October 27, 2000 	CD-ROM 	While released after the Apple merger, these versions are still very close to NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP. Arguably closer to NeXTSTEP than to Mac OS X. For example, they can still be used as remote display via NXHost.

Versions up to 4.1 are general releases. OPENSTEP 4.2 pre-release 2 is a bug-fix release published by Apple and supported for five years after its September 1997 release.
