Sherman is a set of configuration files for WacOS using the m4 language. It is named after the M4 Sherman tank, a United States tank used in World War II.

## Military use

Despite providing no real benefit to combat use, usage of this library is NOT allowed in aiding the violence/death against people in warfafe/combat. The name is only a pun.

## Home repositories

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
