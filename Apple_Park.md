# Apple Park

_This article is about current Apple Inc campus location. For past campus locations, see [Apple Campus](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Apple_Campus/)_

## Planning and cost

The modern Apple campus was designed to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, as envisioned by Steve Jobs. The campus cost $5USD billion to build. It was completed in 2017. It contains a nature refuge for various plants native to California.

## Land development

The park is commonly criticized for taking up too much land that could be used for small houses. I feel like there should be balance between nature and human life, and that there should be giant parks, and not just houses and smog on every square centimeter of the planet. I am against the criticism of it being a waste of space, having a park is important for quality of life, even if the park is only to be visited by Apple employees and friends of Apple employees.
