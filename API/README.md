# WacOS API

## About

The WacOS API is the API that helps with the development of WacOS. It is currently written in 6 languages:

- AppleScript
- C
- Metal
- Objective-C
- Objective-C++
- Swift

Pascal, and other languages might be supported in the future.

It aims to implement APIs for Metal, Cocoa/CocoaTouch, and all the other Apple APIs

It is highly incomplete, and is currently not functional.

## API

### AppleScript

The current AppleScript API is not yet functional, but has a base structure that is partially ready. It is bootstrapped in AppleScript (written in AppleScript to support AppleScript) however, this may not work in the long run.

It supports 3 version variants:

- Version 2.5 (a recreation of AppleScript 2.5, the last version of AppleScript made by Apple, dated to 2014, October 16th)
- Version 2.0
- Version 1.0

I need to find a source for the version history of AppleScript and its features to better suited for the project.

The following keywords are currently supported:

`tell`

The following comment types are supported:

- `-- Single line comment (all versions)`
- `# Single line comment (AppleScript 2.0 and later)`

```applescript
(* Multi-line
comment
(universal) *)
```

### Metal

The current metal API is incomplete, and doesn't work at all. It does not have a base yet.

### Objective-C

The current Objective-C API is incomplete, and doesn't work at all. It does not have a base yet.

### Objective-C++

The current Objective-C API is incomplete, and doesn't work at all. It does not have a base yet.

### Swift

The current Swift API is incomplete, and doesn't work at all. It does not have a base yet.

### Cocoa

The current Cocoa API is incomplete, and doesn't work at all. It does not have a base yet.

### C

The current C API is incomplete, and doesn't work at all. It does not have a base yet.

## Legacy description

This is the collection of API (Application Programming Interface) sets for the WacOS operating system project.

The current APIs aim to imitate the MacOS and iOS CocoaTouch and Metal APIs, along with support for Objective-C and Swift. Additional APIs are coming soon

## Home repositories

These are the mainhouse and guesthouse links for this project

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_API/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
