# WacOS API

## About

The WacOS API is the API that helps with the development of WacOS. It is currently written in 6 languages:

- AppleScript
- C
- Metal
- Objective-C
- Objective-C++
- Swift

Pascal, and other languages might be supported in the future.

It aims to implement APIs for Metal, Cocoa/CocoaTouch, and all the other Apple APIs

It is highly incomplete, and is currently not functional.

## Home repositories

These are the mainhouse and guesthouse links for this project

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_API/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
