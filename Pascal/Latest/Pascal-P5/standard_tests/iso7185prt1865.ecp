                    succ() and pred() are not the same as operators, which generally yield 
                    integer, but instead they give the same type as the operand:

                    pred(x) 
                 
                    From the expression x that shall be of an ordinal-type, this function shall 
                    return a result that shall be of the same type as that of the expression  
                    (see 6.7.1). The function shall yield a value whose ordinal number is one  
                    less than that of the expression x, if such a value exists. It shall be an  
                    error if such a value does not exist.
