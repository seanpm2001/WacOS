                                There are four possible cases for active variants: 
                 
                                   A: Reference to discriminated variant. 
                                   B: Change to the tagfield of a discriminated variant with 
                                      an outstanding reference. 
                                   C: Read of an undiscriminated variant after a write. 
                                   D: Write of an undiscriminated variant with outstanding 
                                      reference. 
                 
                                This is case D.

                     sure the compiler sees it. This would rely on the compiler both allocating 
                     a tagfield, and automatically assigning it on write. }
