                         THE P5 COMPILER/INTERPRETER

============================== Description =====================================

This is the 5th version of the Pascal-P compiler from Zurich. This is the
Pascal-P4 compiler modified to be ISO 7185 Pascal compilant, both in the the
implementation language, and in the language it processes. It is the first
version of Pascal-P created outside of Zurich.

Pascal-P was an implementation kit, created between 1972 and 1974, for the
original language Pascal. The source for the original compiler was passed around
and modified quite a bit, but Niklaus Wirth noted that it was very popular, and
represented a good method to popularize the language. He gathered the source
into a clean version called Pascal-P2, which was the basis of UCSD Pascal, which
in turn was the base language for Borland Pascal. The Zurich group then created
an improved version called Pascal-P4.

Pascal-P5 is Pascal-P4 modified to accept all of the ISO 7185 language.

The full instructions for running and setting up the P5 compiler/interpreter
have all been incorporated into the document:

doc/the_p5_compiler.docx

Please consult this document for full instructions on how to use Pascal-P5.

============================== Quick start =====================================

Pascal-p5 uses the standard GNU release layout. You execute:

[Windows]

> setpath
> configure
> make

[linux]

> . ./setpath
> ./configure
> make

(You can avoid "setpath" by placing the ./bin directory on your path)

This will make the compiler and interpreter set. You can then try a sample
program as:

> p5 sample_programs/hello

================================== Problems ====================================

You need a working gpc implementation. It is strongly suggested you use the
gpc version 20070904. gpc has/had various compliance issues with ISO 7185, and
the compiler has ceased to be supported. This version is found to be solid.

You will need a working set of linux tooling (grep, ls, rm, etc). Mingw has
an excellent set of tools for Windows users.

You need the "flip" line ending adapation program. If you don't have it, we
include a copy you can compile, or you can simply go find it. It is a widely
available program.
