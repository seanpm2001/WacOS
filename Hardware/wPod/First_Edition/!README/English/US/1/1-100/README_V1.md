# WacOS hardware

## wPod First Edition

I have started planning out a personal device for playing music. I decided that it should run WacOS (specifically wOS 6 by default) I started planning this out on 2022 May 7th, and didn't group it into the WacOS project until May 9th.

I don't know how I got the timing so right. Literally the next day (2022, Tuesday, May 10th) Apple announced it was discontinuing the iPod Touch (and thus the iPod line permanently) and limited stock was available. This generates demand for a replacement, and I had just started planning a replacement,

Of course, it won't be made by Apple, it won't run iOS, and it won't be entirely the same. The current plan is to have blueprints, and STL+GCODE files, so that the user can build the device themselves. I currently plan to have the device run via Raspberry Pi Nano technology, along with a 3D printed case, and some other parts.

One unique feature I have for this device is to make it a 2 in one device. The original iPod click wheel will be present, it can be rolled out, or put back in. When rolled out, it (optionally) takes away touchscreen capabilities (temporarily) and makes the device operate like an iPod classic. Roll it back up, and it is like an iPod Touch.

The devices storage will be done through an SD card. You can choose whatever SD card size you want, for myself, I will be starting off with a 1 terabyte card. You can get any SD card size you want, as long as it is a MicroSD card.

The device is named wPod, as it is a WacOS pod, and runs wOS by default. I have plans to build a partitioning tool to partition most of the directories to be read only, while some to be write-ready. You don't have to do this to your device, and it won't be the default.

VLC Media Player will be the default media player. It will also have a good battery life (hoping to get at least 24 hours, at a rate of constant 40% CPU usage) it will also have 24 bit or higher audio, and will support all the formats VLC supports. It will have a headphone jack, a USB 3 port, and a USB C charging port.

I have not chosen out a CPU or GPU yet, but it definitely won't be NVIDIA. I hope to use an AMD CPU over Intel.

The device is still in planning. It is not yet confirmed.
