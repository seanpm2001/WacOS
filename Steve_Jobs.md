Steve Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. Born on February 24th 1955 in San Francisco California, he was put up for adoption. He was adopted by -subject name here- and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area. Jobs went to Reed College in 1972, but dropped out the same year and went to India seeking enlightenment and buddhism.

He came back in 1976, and co-founded Apple Computer Company with [Steve Wozniak](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Steve_Wozniak/) and began to manufacture sell computers.

Apple started to experience failures, such as that with the Apple Lisa, and in 1985, he was kicked from the company by then-CEO John Sculley. In the same year, Jobs took some employees from Apple and went and founded [NeXT](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NeXT/) producing the object-oriented [NeXTStep](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/NeXTStep/) which would be the foundation for the computer used by Tim Berners Lee to create the worlds first web browser. It also served as the base for Mac OS X when he came back to the company when Apple bought NeXT. The company had still been having problems, and it started to get turned around again.

In 2001, the original MacOS was superceded by Mac OS X. The company continued onward. Development for the first iPhone went underway, until its release in 2007, as the [iPhone 2G](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhone_2G/) which further increased the companies prevelance.

However in 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Instead of following his doctors orders to get it treated, Jobs tried "experimental medicines" to cure it for 9 months, which destroyed his chance to survive it, as the 9 month wait to try scientific treatments was too long. Steve Jobs succumbed to cancer on October 5th 2011. He was 56 years old. His death overshadowed the death of [Dennis Ritchie](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie/) which was even worse.
