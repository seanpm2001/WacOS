=== About ===

I chose WikiText as the 14th project language file for this project, as WikiText is beginning to get used on this project, and it needs its own project language file.

This is an instance in which I am using WikiText/MediaWiki as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out 2 days ago when snooping around on [https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes Apple/Swift Evolution] and I have now expanded it to 4 languages. if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your <code>.gitattributes</code> file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but <code>.gitattributes</code>)

<code>*.wiki linguist-detectable=true</code>

<code>*.wiki linguist-documentation=false</code>
