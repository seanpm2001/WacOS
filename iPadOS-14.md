It was announced on June 22, [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/) at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) as the successor to [iPadOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-13/), making it the second version of the [iPadOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS/) fork from [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/). It was released to the public on September 16, [2020](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2020/).

##System features

### Home screen

#### Widgets

To the left of the first page, the Today View is replaced by a scrollable widget UI. Widgets may be added, with options for small, medium, or large widgets. Widgets of the same size may be stacked over each other and swiped between for convenience; a Smart Stack may be placed which automatically show the most relevant widget to the user based on the time of day. Unlike in [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/), widgets cannot be placed directly on to the home screen in iPadOS 14; this was only allowed starting in [iPadOS 15](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-15/).

#### Compact UI

A series of changes were made in iPadOS 14 to reduce the visual space taken by previously full-screen interfaces; such interfaces now appear and hover in front of an app, allowing for touch (and therefore multitasking) on the app behind. Voice calling interfaces, including Phone, or other third-party apps such as Skype, are made substantially thinner, taking approximately as much space as a notification. Siri's interface is now also compact.

#### Search and Siri

Improvements to the Search feature on the home screen were made, including a refined UI, quick launcher for apps, more detailed web search, shortcuts to in-app search, and improved as-you-type search suggestions. The search function now appears and functions more like the Spotlight Search feature of macOS.

In addition to being made compact, Siri can now answer a broader set of questions and translate more languages. Users can also share their ETA with contacts and ask for cycling directions.

#### Storage

iPadOS 14 gains the ability to mount encrypted external drives. However, this capability is limited to [APFS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/APFS/)-encrypted drives. Upon connecting an [APFS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/APFS/)-encrypted external drive to the USB-C port on the iPad, the Files app will present the external drive on the sidebar. Selecting the drive will prompt the user to enter the password to unlock the drive.
