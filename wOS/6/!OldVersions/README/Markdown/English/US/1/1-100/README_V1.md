# wOS 6

An open source recreation of iOS 6, part of the WacOS operating system project. Written in C.

This project is currently very early in development, and is not yet functional.

## Why V6

The reason why I specifically started work with version 6 opposed to any other version, is because iOS 6 was the last Apple operating system I used outside of a virtual machine. I have knowledge of how the system worked, looked, and I also have lots of nostalgia for it. Recently, I have begun planning a device that only plays music. I may have to stretch some limits, as I need to support 500-1000 gigabytes of data. This separate device should be my new "iPod"

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/wOS_6/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
