_iPadOS 13, the initial release of iPadOS_

( **Forked from:** [iOS 12](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-12/) or [iOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-13/) | **Current version** `15.1 beta` (2021 September 21st) as of 2021 September 24th )

iPadOS is a mobile tablet operating system by Apple Inc from September 24th 2019 that was forked from either [iOS 12](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-12/) or [iOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-13/) originally, the iPad was first released with a modified version of [iPhoneOS 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-3/) and the iPad continued to use [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) until the release of the fork [iPadOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-13/) that was specifically designed for Apples tablets. Since then, the Apple series of iPads has been running iPadOS, while the Apple series of iPhones and iPods runs [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/)

It is a modified version of [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) that better supports touch screen tablet devices, but differs from [MacOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS/) by not being a full desktop.
