# The WacOS ecosystem

> The polar opposite of the Apple Ecosystem

## Changes

- Not a closed platform (or walled garden) instead it is an open platform
- All open source, instead of small amounts of open source (and lots of proprietary source code)
- Community owned, instead of owned by a corporation
- Copyleft, instead of copyright
- No excessively long EULAs and unfair license agreements
- No patent nonsense
- No device lockdown, WacOS should be able to work on any device you run it on, and not just the hardware by the developer
- No DRM
- Hardware is made in democratic countries, and also doesn't use child labor, or sweatshop conditions (looking at you, FOXCONN) it will be made in Europe and the Americas

## Kept the same

- Design (but not exact)
- Consistency
