_As of 2021 September 24th, releases 10.14 (Mojave) and later are still supported and are receiving updates. The data here will need to be updated in the future._

( **Predecessor:** [MacOS 11.0 (Big Sur))](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-11-0-Big-Sur/) | **Successor:** `None` )

macOS Monterey (version 12) is the 18th major release of macOS, Apple's desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. The successor to [macOS Big Sur](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-11-0-Big-Sur/), it was announced at WWDC 2021 on June 7, [2021](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2021/), and is expected to be released later in [2021](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2021/). A beta version of macOS Monterey was released to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program on June 7, [2021](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2021/). A public beta version was released at the beginning of July [2021](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/2021/).

The operating system is named after Monterey Bay, following Apple's tradition of naming macOS releases after locations in California that started with OS X (now macOS) [10.9 Mavericks](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/OS-X-10-9-Mavericks) replacing the former tradition of naming each macOS release after big cats.

## Changes

Changes, including those showcased during the WWDC 2021 keynote, include:

Introduction of Shortcuts for the Mac

Introduction of TestFlight for the Mac

Universal Control, which allows a single keyboard and mouse to interact across multiple Macs and iPads at once (Available on Mac computers with the Apple M1 chip and Mac computers with an Intel processor on MacBook Pro (2016 and later), MacBook (2016 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2017 and later), iMac (5K Retina 27-inch, Late 2015), iMac Pro, Mac mini (2018 and later), and Mac Pro (2019). iPad requirements: iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and 
iPad mini (5th generation and later).)

Redesigned Safari browser

Support for playing AirPlay content received from iOS and iPadOS devices, as well as from other Macs (Available on MacBook Pro (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2019 and later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac mini (2020 and later), Mac Pro (2019), iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later). Older iPhone, iPad, and Mac models may share content at a lower resolution to supported Mac models when “Allow AirPlay for” is set to “Everyone” or “Anyone on the same network” in Sharing preferences.)

Enhancements to FaceTime, including the ability to share screen, and the SharePlay feature which provides a way to experience content simultaneously and in sync (e.g. music or TV shows)

Ability to factory reset the device from the System Preferences app

Live Text to copy, paste, translate and lookup text in Photos, Screenshot, Quick Look, and Safari (work across all Mac that support macOS Monterey since beta 4)

Focus to set different modes to filter notifications across iPhone and iPad

Introduces Low Power Mode for Mac (Supported on MacBook (Early 2016 and later) and MacBook Pro (Early 2016 and later).)

Removal of PHP

The parameters of the Time Machine backup functionality have been tweaked to exclude a greater extent of system files.

## Applications

### Notes

The Notes application includes the ability to apply arbitrary, user-generated tags to any note (e.g. #cooking, #work). A complementary Tag Browser in the sidebar and Smart Folders allow visualization of notes tagged with a particular tag or combination of tags. New functionality called Quick Notes enables creation of a note from within any app via invocation of a system-wide keyboard shortcut or hot corner.

### Maps

The Maps app includes a new interactive globe, redesigned transit experience, and new place card. The interactive globe lets you discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.

## System requirements

macOS Monterey is compatible with all Macs equipped with Apple silicon SoCs, as well as the following models equipped with Intel CPUs:

MacBook: Early 2016 and newer

MacBook Air: Early 2015 and newer
