# WacPaint

[Repository (seanpm2001/WacPaint/)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacPaint/) or [Mirror (in WacOS)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/master/Programs/Legacy/WacPaint/)

WacPaint is a program extra for legacy WacOS (8 bit and 16 bit only) that is meant to imitate MacPaint, but not just be a copy of its source code. It will have its own graphics, and will be a functional low-level raster graphics editor.

The classic mode (legacy) aims to imitate the original software. It supports all the same features MacPaint does, but only works on 8 and 16 bit versions. It is compatible with 4 languages (English, French, German, and Spanish) and can be used as a very simple raster graphics editor. It can also switch emulation modes to imitate any version of MacPaint (in the scope of versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0)

The advanced mode (wacky) aims to have the same features as the legacy mode and still be for legacy WacOS, but also support 32 bit architectures, a plethora of basic features and advanced customizations, include extended language support (Esperanto, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, South Korean, Czech, Portuguese, Finnish, Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Swedish, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Uyghur, and Classical Mongolian (Although no Telugu support to match MacOS and the Telugu bug) support for new file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, HEIF, and SVG (the main vector format)

Emojis still aren't supported, as they require a more modern system. This version can also export in the ODT, UOT, and PDF formats.

WacPaint does not have its own icon yet, MacPaint doesn't appear to have an icon either, so for now, no icon is being used.
