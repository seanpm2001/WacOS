# WacOS

## AMD Drivers repository

This is the place for AMD device drivers for WacOS. The drivers are written in C, and are not functional yet. They are currently the only processor type supported by WacOS.

The following AMD platforms are supported:

- [x] AMD 64 bit
- - [ ] No specific processors listed

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_AMD-Drivers/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
