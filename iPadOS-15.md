## Features

### Home screen

The home screen grid has been reduced by one row to accommodate the new widgets, and rotates in portrait orientation, just like [iOS 12](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-12/) and earlier.

#### Widgets

Widgets can now be placed directly anywhere on the home screen. There are more widgets, many of which are bigger.

#### App Library

iPadOS 15 introduces the App Library from the iPhone in [iOS 14](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-14/) to the iPad.

#### Multitasking

New multitasking user interface allows users to enter split view, slide over, enter full screen with quick gestures. The multiwindow shelf gives quick access to all running apps.

A new feature, called Quick Note, can be taken by swiping from the corner with fingers or the Apple Pencil, the Control Center or a keyboard shortcut.

#### Safari

Safari has been redesigned just like in [iOS 15](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS-15/) and [macOS Monterey](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/MacOS-12-0-Monterey/). Safari has tab groups which allow the user to organize tabs into user-defined groups. Users can download third party extensions for Safari in the App Store.

#### Other

Universal Control allows a user to use a single keyboard and mouse across different Macs and iPads and new keyboard shortcuts have been added in iPadOS 15.

The Translate app is now available in iPadOS 15.

[iPadOS 13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPadOS-13/) wallpapers were removed in the first beta of iPadOS 15.

iPadOS 15 features a new wallpaper in two modes: light and dark.

All models of iPad now have a "low power mode" option, like the [iOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS/) "low power mode" option, in Settings.
