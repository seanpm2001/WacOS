## OpenAPFS file system

### About the OpenAPFS file system

The openAPFS file system is an open source alternative to the APFS (APple File System) found on modern Apple devices.

This projects goal is to recreate APFS in a more open fashion and keep compatibility with Apple devices running APFS. It will likely use some sort of FUSE setup. Support will only be available on Linux, BSD, and other open source systems.

## Language

The OpenAPFS file system is currently written in C++, but will also be written in other langugaes as well.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_OpenAPFS/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
