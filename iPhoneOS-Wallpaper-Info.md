## Wallpapers for iPhoneOS

![https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/blob/master/Graphics/iPhoneOS/IPhone_OS_1_screenshot.jpg](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/blob/master/Graphics/iPhoneOS/IPhone_OS_1_screenshot.jpg)

[iPhoneOS 1-3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iPhoneOS-version-history/) does not support custom or pre-installed wallpapers. Support for custom/pre-installed wallpapers was added with [iOS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/iOS_4/) previous versions only supported a solid black wallpaper. This wallpaper was done, as either it was easiest to implement/easiest on the small processor early iPhones had, or it was not thought of until iOS 4.
