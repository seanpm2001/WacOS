    // I chose Objective-C as the third project language file for this project (WacOS/WOAHS-X 10.7) as Objective-C is a core language for Apple API sets, and I need support for it. It may be possible to use this language at the system level for this project alongside C and x86 Assembly. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
