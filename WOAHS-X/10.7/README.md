# WOAHS X 10.7

WOAHS-X 10.7 is an open source recreation of OS X 10.7. It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Objective-C, and AppleScript

### Programming language support

Objective-C is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of Wac OS X 10.6)

Python version 2.5 is included (As of Wac OS X 10.5)

Ruby 1.8.6 is included (As of Wac OS X 10.5)

## Features

Features to replicate

Source: [OS X 10.7 - Wikipedia (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OS_X_Lion&oldid=1086545219)
 
Some new features were announced at the "Back to the Mac" keynote in October 2010, and the Apple website was updated in February 2011, with more details. Other features were announced at the WWDC 2011 keynote or on Apple's Mac OS X Lion Web site after the keynote. Apple states that there are over 250 new or changed features in Lion, including:

- [ ] Address Book uses an iPad-like user interface. It also includes improved Yahoo support and FaceTime calling.
- [ ] AirDrop – Lion-to-Lion direct file sharing via Wi-Fi Direct, with no wireless access point required.
- [ ] Address space layout randomization – Address space layout randomization (ASLR), a security technique that puts important data in unpredictable locations, making it harder to target known weaknesses, is available for 32-bit applications, and "has been improved for all applications", in Lion.
- [ ] Apple Push Notification Service – Send over-the-air alerts, such as news updates or social networking status changes, using Apple's Push Notification service to applications that support APNS. APNS allows Mac OS X Lion and iOS clients to receive push changes to items such as mail, calendar and contacts from a configured OS X Lion Server.
- [ ] Auto-correction behaves much like on iOS devices, displaying an iOS-like popup box.
- [ ] Auto Save – As in iOS, documents in applications written to use Auto Save are saved automatically so users do not have to worry about manually managing their documents. The Auto Save feature significantly alters traditional workflow patterns and is a controversial addition to the system.
- [ ] Emoji support – Apple has added a new Emoji font commonly used in chat to express ideograms.
- [ ] Exposé in the Dock, a way of activating Exposé for a single application from the Dock, a feature added in Mac OS X 10.6, is altered. One must double-tap with two fingers on a dock icon to initiate single-application Exposé, or simply right-click or control-click and select Show All Windows.
- [ ] FaceTime comes bundled with Lion.
- [ ] FileVault offers full disk encryption and added security with XTS-AES 128 data encryption. Support for FileVault on external hard drives has also been added.
- [ ] Finder improvements – Finder search allows multiple search criteria to be specified without creating a smart folder, Finder search offers suggestions, files can be grouped by various attributes, and one can merge files under two folders with the same name – a prompt appears asking to replace or keep both files. The navigation sidebar lost the ability to show the specific icon of a map or volume (by default; there is a hack to still add the old ability), instead it shows a grey standard map icon.
- [ ] Font Book 3 – Font Book 3 provides more flexible displays of character glyphs supplied by a particular font face. Duplicate font files are flagged with a warning icon, and can be fixed automatically or resolved manually.
- [ ] Full-screen apps – Native, system-wide support for full-screen applications running in their own space. Supporting applications display a new button at the top right of application window, this button opens applications in full-screen mode. However, full screen mode is not supported for dual screen setups.
- [ ] High-quality multilingual speech voices – users can download new high-quality voices in more than forty languages and dialects.
- [ ] iCal has an updated user interface, an annual view, and support for a full-screen view.
- [ ] iChat has support for logging into Yahoo! Messenger. Users can audio- and video-chat with other iChat users using their Yahoo! accounts.
- [ ] Languages/Localization – Arabic, Czech, Turkish and Hungarian are added as full system languages, to make the total number of twenty-two languages available in Mac OS X.
- [ ] Launchpad – An application launcher that displays an iOS-like icon grid of installed applications. It features the ability to make multiple pages and group apps into folders that function the same as folders in iOS.
- [ ] Mac App Store – An application store built in the image of the iOS App Store. Like in iOS, it provides ways for shoppers to discover apps, one-click installation of apps, and one-click updates of all or selected installed applications. Despite being announced as a future feature of Lion, the Mac App Store was released for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard on January 6, 2011, as it was bundled with the Mac OS X 10.6.6 update.
- [ ] Mail 5 – Uses an iPad-like user interface, has a fullscreen-optimized view, uses chronological "Conversations" to organize messages, and supports Exchange 2010 (but not through the Exchange ActiveSync protocol, as iOS).
- [ ] Mission Control replaces the "All windows" Exposé feature. It gives an overview of all running applications just like "All windows" but groups windows from the same application. At the top of the screen it gives quick access to the Dashboard, Spaces, and running full-screen applications.
- [ ] Multi-touch gestures – Similar to iOS, additional gestures performed using a multi-touch input device (e.g. Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad) allow the user to scroll, swipe to different pages, and enter Mission Control. While this is not the first official multi-touch support for Mac OS X, it has been expanded; other frameworks, such as Lux, have already created multi-touch support.
- [ ] Multi-User Screen Sharing – The built-in Screen Sharing feature allows remote users to log into a separate user account from the one that is currently logged in. While one user is logged into a machine, a second user can log into the same machine remotely, seeing their own desktop and user environment.
- [ ] Preview gains several features, including full-screen support and the ability to sign a document just by holding a signed piece of paper up to the camera.
- [ ] Profile Manager provides several features, including push notification-based management of OS X Lion and above.
- [ ] QuickTime reincorporates some features from QuickTime Pro. New features cited include Copy/Paste, Insert Clip, Crop Video, Rotate Video, Resize, Trim, and more Export options.
- [ ] Recovery Partition – Apple has introduced a recovery partition that includes utilities generally found on the OS X discs. This partition permits the user to restore their computer to its original factory state. If the partition were to become damaged or otherwise not available, such as with a new drive, a new copy of OS X Lion can be installed over the internet.
- [ ] Resume – Applications resume in the same state when re-opened as already seen in iOS.
- [ ] Safari – With full-screen mode and the new WebKit2 layout engine.
- [ ] System Information – This feature is a re-design of System Profiler, which has been completely altered with new views which display graphical information on displays, storage devices, memory usage along with other hardware information. The previous layout remains available by clicking "System Report". Early builds of Lion also used System Information as a replacement for "About This Mac", although the final release reinstated the version of this dialog box found in Snow Leopard.
- [ ] Terminal has extra features, including full screen mode.
- [ ] TextEdit gains a new graphical toolbar with font selection and text highlighting. The new TextEdit also supports Apple's new automatic file saving and versions technologies.
- [ ] Versions – Time Machine-like saving and browsing of past versions of documents for applications written to use Versions.
- [ ] Vertical text – Lion supports vertical layouts for East Asian languages.

The complete list was on Apple's website but has since been taken down; it can now be found on the Internet Archive. The developer release notes may also be of interest.
### Server features

- [ ] Wiki Server 3 – Making it easier to collaborate, share, and exchange information. Users can quickly switch between a server's home page, My Page, Updates, Wikis, People, and Podcasts. File sharing is simpler, and a new Page Editor is added for easy customization.
- [ ] WebDAV File Sharing – Lion Server delivers wireless file sharing for clients that support WebDAV. Enabling WebDAV in Lion Server gives iOS users the ability to access, copy, and share documents on the server from applications such as Keynote, Numbers, and Pages.
- [ ] Profile Manager – Profile Manager delivers simple, profile-based setup and management for Mac OS X Lion, iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. It also integrates with existing directory services and delivers automatic over-the-air profile updates using the Apple Push Notification service.

### User interface changes

- [ ] edesigned Aqua user interface elements, including buttons and progress bars. The red, yellow, and green buttons in the window decorations have also been made smaller, with a slightly changed design.
- [ ] Flexible window resizing from any corner or edge of the window, similar to window resizing in Microsoft Windows and many window managers for X11.
- [ ] The metal finish has also been slightly altered. It is a lighter shade of grey and features a speckled texture.
- [ ] Scrollbar arrows have been removed.
- [ ] Scrolling is reversed by default, to act more like a touch screen device, so that content moves in the direction of finger movement on touch-pad or mouse (with the scrollbar moving in the opposite direction), rather than the scrollbar moving in the direction of finger movement (with the content moving in the opposite direction). Also, like in iOS, scrolling "bounces" when the scroll bar hits the top or bottom of the window.
- [ ] When resizing a window by clicking on the green button (left-top), a transform effect animates the enlargement.
- [ ] New windows fly to the front (like opening an app in iOS).
- [ ] The dashboard is its own space in Mission Control, rather than in previous versions of OS X where the widgets simply flew in and the background dimmed. The "ripple effect" that was seen previously when adding widgets is no longer there due to this change. Users have the option to return to the old dashboard configuration in System Preferences.
- [ ] Tabs, when selected, have a recessed and darkened appearance as opposed to previous versions where selected tabs were highlighted in aqua blue.

### Dropped features

- [ ] Save As – replaced by Duplicate and Revert functions due to the introduction of Auto Save and Versions (only applies to applications modified to support Auto Save, such as TextEdit; applications not modified to support Auto Save, such as Microsoft Word, retain this functionality).
- [ ] Front Row, a media center application. The application has been copied into Lion by third-party users, however its incompatibility with iTunes 10.4 renders some features useless.
- [ ] Rosetta, software that makes possible the execution of PowerPC software on x86 hardware, is no longer available. This disables some programs that ran on previous versions of Mac OS X Programs requiring Rosetta to operate are not allowed to be distributed via the Mac App Store.
- [ ] Adobe Flash Player and Apple's Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are not included in new installations of Lion, but both can still be downloaded and installed manually.] Apple is no longer actively maintaining its JRE, but Software Update offers to download Snow Leopard's JRE when a user tries to run a Java program and the JRE is not installed. Programs using Java are not allowed to be distributed via the Mac App Store.
- [ ] iSync, software used for syncing contacts and calendars to third-party mobile phones, is no longer included; however, iSync v3.1.2 from Snow Leopard continues to work.
- [ ] Remote Install Mac OS X, software that allows OS X to be installed using the Remote Disk feature. Using Target Disk Mode, users can circumvent this omission. This is replaced by the Recovery Partition, which does exactly the same thing but without needing an external disk, as long as the hard disk is not damaged.
- [ ] Apple USB Modem is not compatible with Lion.
- [ ] QuickTime Streaming Server, software used to deliver video and audio on request to users over a computer network, including the Internet.
- [ ] WPA Enterprise configuration for wireless networks was replaced by the requirement to obtain a configuration profile.
- [ ] The Post-Install Welcome Video was removed.
    
### Boot screen

The `Happy Wac` is disabled by default on boot to match the release (starting with Wac OS X 10.2) and on boot, the letter `W` will show. By default, on the first install, it will go with the brand logo (The W logo with a big cat texture) then it will be the `Modern1` logo (The W logo with a metal texture) This can be changed in [`WACOS_10-6_BOOT.cfg`](/10.46WACOS_10-6_BOOT.cfg)

### File system

OpenHFS+ 2.0 is still the default file system. OpenZFS is included, but is in read-only mode.

### Codecs

No new codecs are supported in this release.

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_X_10.7/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
