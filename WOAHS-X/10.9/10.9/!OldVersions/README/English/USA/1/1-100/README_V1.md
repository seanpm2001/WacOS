# WOAHS X 10.9

WOAHS-X 10.9 is an open source recreation of OS X 10.9. It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Objective-C, and AppleScript

### Programming language support

Objective-C is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of Wac OS X 10.6)

Python version 2.5 is included (As of Wac OS X 10.5)

Ruby 1.8.6 is included (As of Wac OS X 10.5)

Swift is now supported (Starting with WOAHS X 10.9)

## Features

Features to replicate

Source: [OS X 10.9 - Wikipedia (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OS_X_Mavericks&oldid=1089774190)

### System features

The menu bar and the Dock are available on each display. Additionally, AirPlay compatible displays such as the Apple TV can be used as an external display. Mission Control has been updated to organize and switch between Desktop workspaces independently between multiple displays.

OS X Mavericks introduced App Nap, which sleeps apps that are not currently visible. Any app running on Mavericks can be eligible for this feature by default.

Compressed Memory is a virtual memory compression system which automatically compresses data from inactive apps when approaching maximum memory capacity.

Timer coalescing is a feature that enhances energy efficiency by reducing CPU usage by up to 72 percent. This allows MacBooks to run for longer periods of time and desktop Macs to run cooler.

Apple now supports OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile and OpenCL 1.2. Server Message Block version 2 (SMB2) is now the default protocol for sharing files, rather than AFP. This is to increase performance and cross-platform compatibility.

Some skeuomorphs, such as the leather texture in Calendar, the legal pad theme of Notes, and the book-like appearance of Contacts, have been removed from the UI.

iCloud Keychain stores a user's usernames, passwords and Wi-Fi passwords to allow the user to fill this information into forms when needed.

The system has native LinkedIn sharing integration.

IPoTB (Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge) Thunderbolt networking is supported in Mavericks. This feature allows the user to quickly transfer a large amount of data between two Macs.

Notification Center allows the user to reply to notifications instantly,] allows websites to send notifications, and, when the user wakes up a Mac that was in a sleep state, displays a summary of missed notifications before the machine is unlocked. Some system alerts, such as low battery, removal of drives without ejecting, and a failed Time Machine backup have been moved to Notification Center.

The "traffic light" close, minimize, and maximize window buttons have appeared somewhat brighter than Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion.

### App features

Finder gets enhancements such as tabs, full-screen support, and document tags. Pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-navigate-history gestures have been removed, although both are supported anywhere else.

The new iBooks application allows the user to read books purchased through the iBooks Store. The app also allows the user to purchase new content from the iBooks Store, and a night mode to make it easier to read in dark environments.

The new Maps application allows the user the same functionality as in iOS Maps.

The Calendar app has enhancements such as being able to add Facebook events, and an estimate for the travel time to an event.

The Safari browser has a significantly enhanced JavaScript performance which Apple claims is faster than Chrome and Firefox. A Top Sites view allows the user to quickly access the most viewed sites by default. However, the user can pin or remove websites from the view. The sidebar now allows the user to view their bookmarks, reading list and shared links. Safari can also auto-generate random passwords and remember them through iCloud Keychain.

### Removed functionality

The Open Transport API has been removed. USB syncing of calendar, contacts and other information to iOS devices has been removed, instead requiring the use of iCloud. QuickTime 10 no longer supports many older video codecs and converts them to the ProRes format when opened. Older video codecs cannot be viewed in Quick Look. Apple also removed the ability to sync mobile iCloud Notes if iOS devices were upgraded from iOS 8 to iOS 9, effectively forcing all Mavericks users to update or upgrade their computers. 

### Boot screen

The `Happy Wac` is disabled by default on boot to match the release (starting with Wac OS X 10.2) and on boot, the letter `W` will show. By default, on the first install, it will go with the brand logo (The W logo with a big cat texture) then it will be the `Modern1` logo (The W logo with a metal texture) This can be changed in [`WACOS_10-9_BOOTCONFIG.cfg`](/10.9/WACOS_10-9_BOOTCONFIG.cfg)

### File system

OpenHFS+ 2.0 is still the default file system. OpenZFS is included, but is in read-only mode.

### Codecs

No new codecs are supported in this release.

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WOAHS-X_10.9/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
