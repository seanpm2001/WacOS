; Project language file 2
; For: WOAHS-X 10.10
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the second project language for this project (WacOS/WOAHS-X 10.10) because Assembly is a very low level language that can access the required sections of memory needed for parts of this project. It will be used along C (and possibly Objective-C) at the system level for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
