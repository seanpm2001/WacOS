# WOAHS X

WOAHS X is an open source recreation of Mac OS X during the OS X years (spanning from versions 10.7 to 10.11). It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

[Predecessor: Wac OS X](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_X) [Local](/WacOS_X/) | [Successor: Wac OS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_X) [Local](/WacOS_X/) 

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Swift, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, and AppleScript, and more.

### Programming language support

Objective-C is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of Wac OS X 10.6)

Swift is supported in versions 10.9 and up

Python version 2.5 is included (As of Wac OS X 10.5)

Ruby 1.8.6 is included (As of Wac OS X 10.5)

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.
