    // I chose Objective-C as the third project language file for this project (WOAHS-X) as Objective-C is a core language for Apple programming, and is one of the main application languages for the Wac OS X range of projects. It is also already the 3rd project language file for all WOAHS-X subsystems. I am unsure how I will fit in Objective-C++ at the moment, but it will be supported. Objective-C is getting its own project language file, starting here.
