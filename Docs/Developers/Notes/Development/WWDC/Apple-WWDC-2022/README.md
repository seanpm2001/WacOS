# Apple WWDC 2022

## Context

Apple held their yearly WorldWide Developers Conference today (2022, Monday, June 6th) and announced Mac OS 13, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, tvOS16, and WatchOS 9. Those are just the operating systems. There may be more software I need to look up as well.

## Effects on WacOS

At the moment, I am actively working on catching up and matching MacOS and other Apple Operating systems in the earliest phase: project setup.

These releases will slow me down by a day or two for this phase, although it is so early on, that there isn't enough reliable information to accommodate work on WacOS equivalents. I am busy setting up many other things as well right now. There likely won't be any real development for these systems until their full release in the fall of 2022.

Todo: add Wiki articles for Apple WWDC 2022 and all announcements there.
