# Docs for WacOS

## Developers

### WacOS programming language support

**See also:** [WacOS spoken language support](/Docs/Developers/Language/Spoken/README.md)

This article goes over programming language usage on this project. It lists the programming languages that will be used, that won't be used, that are being decided upon, and the ones that are currently in use. This list is currently in development, and is not complete.

As of 2021 December 23rd at 3:20 pm, WacOS is written in 29 different computer languages, and 1 human language (English)

#### Languages that won't be used
