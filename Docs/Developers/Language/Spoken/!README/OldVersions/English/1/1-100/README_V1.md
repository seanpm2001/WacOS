### WacOS spoken language support

**See also:** [WacOS computer language support](/Docs/Developers/Language/Computer/README.md)

This article goes over spoken languages that MacOS is written in. As of 2021 December 23rd, WacOS is only available in English (US) I hope to get some translations to other languages soon.

#### Problems

The Wiki is English only, and there isn't an easy/known way to add multi-lingual support.

Translations are not coming in yet.

#### A guide for translators

Do you know the English language well? You are reading this, so you are already qualified.

There are 2 types of translators for this project:

1. Mother tongue translator - Can speak English and a 2nd/(or 3rd, or 4th, etc.) language fluently without using a translator

2. Machine translator - Can understand English, but not a second language. This type of translator should use a translation service.

You can use whatever translation service you want, whether it be DeepL, Bing Translate, Google Translate, or another one. Machine translation in its current state isn't good enough on its own, so type 2 translators can produce content with errors, and type 1 translators (and the general public) can point out syntax or grammar problems, and open pull requests/issues to fix them.

The content MUST be copy and pasted in its entirety for machine translation. Note that Google Translate has a 5000 character limit PER PAGE but you can easily copy over 100000 characters to translate, and it will give you multiple pages of translated content. Just make sure to stitch it together in the right order, and take out any markdown bugs.

Type 1 translators are greatly appreciated as well. Type 1 translators can translate documents by hand, or go and find errors in machine translations.
