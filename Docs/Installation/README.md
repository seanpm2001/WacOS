## Installing a subsystem

WacOS is a group of subsystems, each subsystem is an operating system. Earlier subsystems (like BaSYS, and Classic WacOS) should only be installed in a virtual machine.

There are subsystems for every Apple system. Further instruction currently isn't available.

## Installing a program

WacOS contains several programs as well. They are written for WacOS, but are portable, and are intended to be run on any Linux/BSD system that supports C, Pascal, Python, and the other languages in use.
