# WacOS project

## Sir Isaac NewtonScript

### About

Sir Isaac Newton OS is a recreation of NewtonOS by Apple, that was originally used on the Apple Newton series of tablets produced by Apple in the early 1990s. Sir Isaac Newton Script is a recreation of NewtonScript, which is a C++ derived language that was used to program NewtonOS. This project uses Isaac Newtons full surname, including the honorary Sir title

Like NewtonScript, SirIsaacNewtonScript is also C++ derived, and is designed to be as light as possible. It is a 8 bit and 16 bit hybrid operating system part of the WacOS project. There is a chance other languages (Io, Self, Smalltalk) will also be used in the future.

## Home repositories

These are the mainhouse and guesthouse links for this project

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SirIsaacNewtonScript/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
