; Project language file 3
; For: WacOS/BaSYS 4
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the third project language for this project (WacOS/BaSYS 4) because Assembly is the best language for hardware interactions, alongside C, and is one of the top languages used on this project. It comes after C and Pascal, due to lesser usage.
