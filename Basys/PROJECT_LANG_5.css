/* I chose CSS3 as the fifth project language file for this project (WacOS/BaSYS) as CSS is the main stylesheet language used in the web demo of this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here. */

/* Now to make this a multi-purpose file, I will add styling for a basic dark mode template */
