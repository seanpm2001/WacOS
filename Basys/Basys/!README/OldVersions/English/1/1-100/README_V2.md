# BaSYS

BaSYS (Base SYStem, formerly in ALL CAPS, now the `a` is lowercase) is an open source recreation of the first 6 major releases of classic MacOS, when the operating system was only known as `System 1` `System 2` `System 3` `System 4` `System 5` and `System 6`

BaSYS is in early development and is still being planned out. It will be a series of 8/16 bit operating systems designed to imitate the versions of MacOS listed above. It is not yet functional.

## Color

The system will be 8 bit Greyscale for BaSYS 1 to 5. BaSYS 6 will have slight coloring to it with 16 bit color.

## Programming language

<!-- Obsolete notes

The programming languages to be used on BASYS are currently being decided. I am currently choosing between one or more of the following:

`C` `Assembly` `FORTRAN` `ALGOL` `BASIC` `COBOL`

It isn't much of a decision yet.

!-->

BaSYS is written in C, Pascal, and Assembly. The web demo donated by [`@peterhil`](https://github.com/peterhil/) is written in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (additionally, I made a TypeScript version out of the existing JavaScript)

### Why C?

C is likely a very common language the original Apple System 1-6 operating systems, and is very useful in operating system development.

### Why Pascal?

Pascal is one of the main program level languages originally used in early versions of Classic Mac OS. To imitate the experience, it is used here as well.

### Why Assembly?

Assembly was one of the main machine languages used in Classic Mac OS. Right now, I am using standard assembly, but may support the Motorola 68K through virtual means in the future.

## What about system 7?

System 7 is too close to MacOS, so it is separate from the first 6 versions of BaSYS. System 7.5 is when the system was renamed to MacOS (which became known as Classic MacOS after the release of Mac OS X 10.0)

## What is the difference between different versions of BaSYS?

Right now, there really isn't too much of a difference between different versions of BaSYS. Version 6 is expected to support color, while the other 5 versions imitate the first 5 versions of Classic Mac OS, matching their features. This is mainly a legacy project, and it is designed to only be run in a virtual machine, or on a very low end computer. Again, the project is not yet functional.

For functionality (when that happens) BaSYS 1 will be the simplest, while BaSYS 6 will be the most advanced. You can then choose a version to use from the spectrum of 6, and choose what works for you.
