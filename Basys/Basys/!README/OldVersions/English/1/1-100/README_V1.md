# BASYS

BASYS (Base SYStem) is an open source recreation of the first 6 major releases of MacOS, when the operating system was only known as `System 1` `System 2` `System 3` `System 4` `System 5` and `System 6`

BASYS is in early development and is still being planned out. It will be a series of 8/16 bit operating systems designed to imitate the versions of MacOS listed above.

## Color

The system will be 8 bit Greyscale for BASYS 1 to 5. BASYS 6 will have slight coloring to it with 16 bit color.

## Programming language

The programming languages to be used on BASYS are currently being decided. I am currently choosing between one or more of the following:

`C` `Assembly` `FORTRAN` `ALGOL` `BASIC` `COBOL`

It isn't much of a decision yet.
