# [@Peterhil](https://github.com/peterhil/)'s System 1 implementation using CSS

Thanks to [@Peterhil](https://github.com/peterhil/) for this donation (it is my second source code donation to date) I have been given permission to use this in its entirety through WacOS/Issue/[5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/5/) as long as I give credit (which I always do)

This is a basic implementation of Apple System 1 using CSS. It was donated to me on 2021 October 17th, but I didn't read the issue until 2021 December 21st.

## Bugs

The credits dialog box covers the display when going into full screen mode. I want to try to put it lower into the page, as I can't just remove it (that would be plagiarism) for now, for your own use, just copy the document and take it out. I currently can't make a version without it

## Warnings

The Apple Logo Unicode character may be unsupported on your system (for me, on Ubuntu 20.04, it shows up as a broken character, as my system does not have good Unicode support) I won't replace it with an Emoji, as it would ruin the project (because it wouldn't match, and because the apple emoji is different on most systems)

## Other

The menu and other graphics/buttons are currently just a still image, and can't be used. The only functional part is the credits dialog, and the finder bar (although none of the options work)
