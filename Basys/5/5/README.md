An open source recreation of Apple System 5, part of the WacOS operating system project. Written in C, Pascal, and Assembly.

This project is currently very early in development, and is not yet functional.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_5/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
