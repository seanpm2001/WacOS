; Project language file 3
; For: WacOS/BaSYS
; About:
; I have decided to make Assembly the third project language for this project (WacOS/BaSYS) because Assembly is the best language for hardware interactions, alongside C, and is one of the top languages used on this project. It comes after C and Pascal, due to lesser usage. Also, the systems this project is based on are mainly written in this language, and it already is the default second anguage for the BaSYS 1-6 guesthouse repositories.
