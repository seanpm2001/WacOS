![The image failed to load](/Cyberdog.gif)

OpenCyberdog is an open source browser for WacOS. It intends to emulate the experience of Cyberdog, Apples first web browser and only web suite. It is going to be one of the 3 default browsers for WacOS.

The other 2 default browsers are:

- [x] Savanna
- [x] Mozilla Firefox ESR

## Engine

It is currently undecided what engine OpenCyberdog will use.

Some intended changes are:

- [ ] Optional toggles for better CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript compliance

Intended features include:

- [ ] A cyberdog like interface
- [ ] A web suite
- [ ] Support for older standards (HTML2, CSS1, etc.)
- [ ] The security of a modern browser
- [ ] A completely open browser

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_OpenCyberdog_Browser/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
