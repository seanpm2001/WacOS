# WacOS

## Savannah browser

Savannah (can be spelled either with or without the `h`) is a small project for a more open version of Safari, with better customization, better privacy, and better performance. It is going to be one of the 3 default browsers for WacOS.

The other 2 default browsers are:

- [x] OpenCyberdog
- [x] Mozilla Firefox ESR

## Engine

Savannah will use an improved version of the WebKit engine. This is not to be confused with Chromium, as both WebKit and Chromium share source code.

Some intended changes are:

- [ ] Optional toggles for better CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript compliance

Intended features include:

- [ ] A safari-like interface by default
- [ ] As much customization power as Firefox
- [ ] The ability to disable JavaScript
- [ ] A completely open browser
- [ ] Cross compatibility, allowing the testing of Safari webpages without owning a Macintosh or iPhone (via Safari mode)

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_Savannah_Browser/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
