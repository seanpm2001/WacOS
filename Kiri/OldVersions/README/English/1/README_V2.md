# WacOS Kiri

## What is kiri

Kiri is a voice assistant software piece that is open source with privacy in mind. Written in Prolog, it is an alternative to Siri, with an easily pronouncable and similar name.

## Name

Kiri was chosen as the name, as it is an uncommon name in software and has not been done yet, and it is very close to Siri. Kiri originally is a gender-neutral Cambodian first name that can translate to `mountain`

## Voice commands

The alias for the command can be customized. Typically, most voice assistants use the word `hey` so that was chosen as the default for similarity and to prevent a learning curve. The command can be customized to:

`yo`

`ok`

`summon`

`activate`

Etc.

## Functionality

A functional build of Kiri is not yet available.

## Queries

Kiri Queries are written in AppleScript.

## Other info

More documentation is coming soon.

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
