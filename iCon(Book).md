iCon is an unauthorizd biography of [Steve Jobs](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Steve_Jobs/) about the return of Steve Jobs to Apple Inc in the late 1990s, and his second act. The title is in reference to Steve Jobs being an icon, while at the same time, saying that Steve Jobs is a con-man, and also referencing Apple products such as iOS, iMac, iPhone, and other Apple products that start with an uncapitalized i.

One of the most common criticisms in the book was of Steve Jobs "Reality distortion field" in response to the criticism, Steve Jobs banned the book on Apple platforms, but in 2010, the publisher and Apple made a deal to bring the books back for the iPad. No further information is available.

<!-- It just has a unique title, and I wanted to make a simplified version of the article (which was already a stub) to comply with the everything Apple rule"
