(108 when not counting English and North Korean, as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/WacOS repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate and Bing Translate due to issues with limited support on other translation services, like DeepL. I will replace Google Translate in the future. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

# WacOS-Description
A Linux distribution that mimics MacOS (modern and classic) iOS, and other Apple operating systems, but is open, customizable, and free to use on non-apple hardware. 

***

## About

About WacOS.

### Concept of WacOS (from August 27th 2019)

**Note**

_As of May 27th 2020 at 11:21 pm, this project is still only just a concept, and is in no way functional yet. I am just laying the foundation at the moment._

**Thought of by Sean on August 27th 2019**

### WacOS (Linux)

Linux distribution that has most of the functionality of MacOS 10.9 but without proprietary features, which includes a desktop environment menu where you can change the theme to make the OS look like any version of MacOS, including:

1. System 1

2. System 2

3. System 3

4. System 4

5. System 5

6. System 6

7. MacOS 7

8. MacOS 8

9. MacOS 9

10. MacOS X Beta

11. MacOS X 10.0

12. MacOS X 10.1

13. MacOS X 10.2

14. MacOS X 10.3

15. MacOS X 10.4

16. MacOS X 10.5

17. MacOS X 10.6

18. MacOS X 10.7

19. OS X 10.8

20. OS X 10.9

Those are all the good environments (skeuomorphic releases)

Below it are the solid color ones which <!-- might not be implementable for a while due to Apples copyright !--> I previously thought couldn't be implemented due to Apples copyright, but flat icons are not copyrightable or claimable, so they can be used here (they lack the uniqueness to have ownership rights()

21. MacOS 10.10

22. MacOS 10.11

23. MacOS 10.12

24. MacOS 10.13

25. MacOS 10.14

26. MacOS 10.15

27. MacOS 11.0

28. MacOS 12.0

It also has iOS theme functionality:

1. iPhone OS 1

2. iPhone OS 2

3. iPhone OS 3

4. iOS 4

5. iOS 5

6. iOS 6

7. iOS 7

8. iOS 8

9. iOS 9

10. iOS 10

11. iOS 11

12. iOS 12

13. iOS 13

14. iOS 14

15. iOS 15

## More info

WacOS will be a Linux based operating system that acts like MacOS, but with improved functionality, being more open, and having new and other features.

its naming (LacOS didn't seem like a good name, as it sounds like "Lack OS" which shouldn't be associated with a Linux distribution, and it was 5:33 in the morning, so I don't know where the W came from. Just note the W does not stand for Windows.

Pronounced like: Whack O S or Walk O S or however you would like to pronounce it

It can act as a MacOS port that isn't developed by apple, and doesn't need an expensive computer to run with. Linux users constantly go through phases of different operating systems themes, a lot of Linux users go through a MacOS phase, I haven't  yet, but I could in the future.

It will be highly functional, and will be written in C for the core, and Python for the system, as I want to continue to spread Python, it is a great programming language, it is simple to write, and very powerful.

Some features include a desktop interface changer that can make the distro function like any version of MacOS, without the restrictiveness, and proprietary functionality.

iOS and MacOS programs from System 1 to the latest version, and iPhone OS 1 to the latest version will be supported.

***

## Development requirements

The system will be at minimum 64 bit, but will contain 32 bit, 16 bit, 8 bit, and 4 bit libraries (I also plan on having 128 bit libraries)

The system MUST be light, with no more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM being used by the system itself at any time. On Idle, it should use no more than 500 Megabytes of RAM.

It must be compatible with virtualization software like VirtualBox, Qemu, VMWare, etc. If anyone wants to go through and make it compatible with hyper-V, it is completely optional

If this is to be completed, it must be better than Windows and MacOS in terms of functionality, and must meet these development requirements to do so.

## Kernel

This project utilizes the Linux kernel. I currently can't connect it via a submodule, as I still can't figure out how to make Git submodules, but the kernel can be downloaded via these sources:

[Kernel.org: The Linux Kernel archives](https://www.kernel.org/)

> [Git repository from Kernel.org for the Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git)

## File Systems

[Read more about the available file systems here](/System/FileSystem/)

### WacOS Default File Systems

#### Overview

WacOS by default has 5 options for a file system upon install. The current 5 options are:

1. [HFS](/System/FileSystem/HFS/)

2. [HFS+](/System/FileSystem/HFS+/)

3. [EXT4](/System/FileSystem/EXT4/)

4. [APFS](/System/FileSystem/APFS/)

5. [OpenZFS](/System/FileSystem/OpenZFS/)

#### Experimental

Support for HFS, APFS, and OpenZFS is currently experimental. APFS might be the hardest, due to it being so new, and having to be reverse engineered first. HFS might be difficult as well due to how old the format is.

BTRFS is currently under consideration for being a 6th option for a default file system.

#### Recommendations

For Apple fans: HFS+, APFS

For less-technical Apple fans: EXT4

For Apple fans with old Apple virtual machines: HFS

For everyone: EXT4

For massive data: OpenZFS

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ssing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

Please note that the Linux Kernel contains a feature called DRM, which isn't bad (because it isn't a type of Digital Restrictions Management, on Linux, it stands for Direct Rendering Manager) there are other projects that unfortunately got a bad name due to the bad DRM term of Digital Restrictions Management.
