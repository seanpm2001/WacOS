### Description

Within the project documentation, I added links to whyWatchOS 1 to 10 today. I didn't notice until version 9 that I had been entering them incorrectly, and decided to keep going with the bad copies, and report it later. The exact issue is that local links are written as `/whyWatchOS/10/` when they should be `/WhyWatchOS/10/` due to inconsistency with file naming. I don't have the time to fix this, so I am putting it out as an extra chore for if I have the time, or for whoever can't stand the inconsistency.

I may upload a separate `/whyWatchOS/` directory, and deprecate the `/WhyWatchOS/` directory to fix the issue.
