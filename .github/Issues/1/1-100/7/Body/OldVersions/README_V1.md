### [Maintenance] Project Wiki maintainers wanted

I am looking for trusted maintainers for this projects [Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/). The project Wiki aims to document the complete history of Apple, along with how it reflects onto this project.

Developers should be able to know:

- [x] Markdown

- [x] Internet Safety

- [x] How to cite sources

- [x] The English language (at a literate level, while being able to write in terms that the general public can understand (Wikipedia's rules are an example))

- [X] Professional Internet etiquette

- [x] Intermediate or higher knowledge of the Apple company, its products, and its history

- [x] Intermediate or higher knowledge of the WacOS project and its goals

The only problem I currently see with maintenance is that I currently don't entirely trust the Wiki system. I fear that an account may be hijacked, and the Wiki could then be vandalized with slurs and other vandalism, including blanking the page.

## Need answer on this first

- [ ] [What happens when I accept a pull request?](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/issues/21/)

- [ ] Is the Wiki safe to be publicly edited by contributors?

- [ ] Am I responsible for any hateful/rule breaking content posted by other contributors?
