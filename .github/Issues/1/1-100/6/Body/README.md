# Peterhil demo fixes

There are some issues related to the web demo I received. I am asking the community for help on how to fix them.

The demo can be found at [BaSYS/1/UI_Demo/Web/Peterhil/](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/master/Basys/1/UI_Demo/Web/peterhil/)

## Bugs

The credits dialog box covers the display when going into full screen mode. I want to try to put it lower into the page, as I can't just remove it (that would be plagiarism)

## Warnings

The Apple Logo Unicode character may be unsupported on your system (for me, on Ubuntu 20.04, it shows up as a broken character, as my system does not have good Unicode support) I won't replace it with an Emoji, as it would ruin the project (because it wouldn't match, and because the apple emoji is different on most systems)

## Other

The menu and other graphics/buttons are currently just a still image, and can't be used. The only functional part is the credits dialog, and the finder bar (although none of the options work)
