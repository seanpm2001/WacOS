### Manpages need improvement

The manpages on this project were added yesterday (2022, Thursday, January 13th) and are a copy and paste of the existing documentation from the `README.md` file, which already didn't contain in-depth enough information for a manual. Along with this, the syntax of the ROFF files is not accurate, and I don't have a way of testing it.

The [manpages](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/WacOS-dev/ManPages/) need improvement.
