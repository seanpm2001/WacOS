# WAMMY

WAMMY is a fun feature pack that is coming soon to give off special features similar to that of the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (TAM/TAMMY)

This feature is currently being decided on.

## Home repositories

These are the mainhouse and guesthouse links for this project

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_WAMMY/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
