# WacPaint

## About

WacPaint is a program extra for legacy WacOS (8 bit and 16 bit only) that is meant to imitate MacPaint, but not just be a copy of its source code. It will have its own graphics, and will be a functional low-level raster graphics editor.

## Language

WacPaint will be available in any approved requested language, the current main ones already planned for are English, Esperanto, Spanish, Polish, French, German, Greek, Russian, and Portuguese.

It will be written in Pascal and Assembly to resemble the original program.

## File format

This program will be able to read and write to the legacy MacPaint supported file extensions. Based on my research, the default formats are:

*.bmp

*.jpg

I cannot confirm any of these at the moment, they are placeholders for when I find the actual extension

## Home repositories

These are the mainhouse and guesthouse links for this project

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacPaint/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
