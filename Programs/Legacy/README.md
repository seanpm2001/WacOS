# Legacy WacOS programs

This directory contains a collection of Legacy WacOS projects that are meant to run on low-end WacOS virtual machines with pre-2002 computer specs. These programs imitate the programs seen in Classic MacOS, and are open source recreations of them.

These are 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit programs. They will not work on Modern WacOS, which is a 128 bit/64 bit operating system. These will only run under legacy (or classic) WacOS.

## Included programs

The following programs are currently included:

1. [WacWrite](/Programs/Legacy/WacWrite/) - An open source recreation of MacWrite, written in C and Assembly. [[view the separate repository]](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacWrite/)

2. [WacPaint](/Programs/Legacy/WacPaint/) - An open source recreation of MacPaint, written in Pascal and Assembly. [[view the separate repository]](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacPaint/)

3. More programs are coming soon.
