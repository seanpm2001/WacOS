# WacWrite

## About

WacWrite is a program extra for legacy WacOS (8 bit and 16 bit only) that is meant to imitate MacWrite, but not just be a copy of its source code. It will have its own graphics, and will be a functional low-level document editor.

## Language

WacWrite will be available in any approved requested language, the current main ones already planned for are English, Esperanto, Spanish, Polish, French, German, Greek, Russian, and Portuguese.

It will be written in C and Assembly.

## File format

This program will be able to read and write to the legacy MacWrite file extensions. Based on my research, the default formats are:

*.maca 

*.macampwd

*.mpwrmw2d

*.mw2dmw2s

*.mw2smwii

*.mwiimwpd 

*.mwpdmwpp

*.mwppmwpr

*.mwpr

I cannot confirm any of these at the moment, they are placeholders for when I find the actual extension
