# Wac OS X 10.7

## Redirection

The original system (MacOS) that this project is based on had a transition between versions 10.7 to 10.11, in a period where it would be known as `OS X`

There was a research issue at first, where I thought that OS X started with 10.8 and ended with 10.10. I later learned that it starts at 10.7 and ends with 10.11.

The project you are looking for is known as `WOAHS-X`
