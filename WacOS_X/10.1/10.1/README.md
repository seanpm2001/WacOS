Apple introduced many features that were missing from the previous version, as well as improving overall system performance.

This system release brought some major new features to the Mac OS X platform:

- [ ] Performance enhancements — Mac OS X 10.1 introduced large performance increases throughout the system.
- [ ] Easier CD and DVD burning — better support in Finder as well as in iTunes
- [ ] DVD playback support — DVDs can be played in Apple DVD Player
- [ ] More printer support (200 printers supported out of the box) — One of the main complaints of version 10.0 users was the lack of printer drivers, and Apple attempted to remedy the situation by including more drivers, although many critics complained that there were still not enough.
- [ ] Faster 3D (OpenGL performs 20% faster) — The OpenGL drivers and handling were vastly improved in this version of Mac OS X, which created a large performance gap for 3D elements in the interface, and 3D applications.
- [ ] Improved AppleScript — The scripting interface now allows scripting access to many more system components, such as the Printer Center, and Terminal, thus improving the customizability of the interface. As well, Apple introduced AppleScript Studio, which allows a user to create full AppleScript applications in a simple graphical interface.
- [ ] Improved filehandling - The Finder was enhanced to optionally hide file extensions on a per-file basis. The Cocoa API was enhanced to allow developers to set traditional Mac type and creator information directly without relying on Carbon to do it.
- [ ] ColorSync 4.0, the color management system and API.
- [ ] Image Capture, for acquiring images from digital cameras and scanners.
- [ ] Menu Extras, a set of items the user can add to the system menu, replacing the supplied Dock Extras from Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah.

Apple switched to using Mac OS X as the default on all then-new Macs with the 10.1.2 release.

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
