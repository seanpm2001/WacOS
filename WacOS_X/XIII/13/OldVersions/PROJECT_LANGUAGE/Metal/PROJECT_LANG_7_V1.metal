// Project language 7
// For: WacOS 13.x/13.0
// About:
// I chose Metal as the seventh project language for this project (WacOS 13.x/13.0) as Metal is an Apple language I want to emulate and resemble it here for cross compatibility and software diversity reasons. It is being used in specific APIs within the system, and may replace GLSL/HLSL in some areas. I decided to resemble all Apple languages through their usage on Wac OS X subsystem projects. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
