## Features

Features to replicate

Source: [MacOS 13 - Wikipedia (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MacOS_Ventura&oldid=1093532988)

There is not enough data yet. I cannot compile a list of features or changes yet. The base operating system isn't planned to be released until Autumn of 2022, and data won't likely be immediately complete then either.

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_13/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
