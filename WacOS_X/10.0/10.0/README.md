Features to replicate

Source: [Mac OS X 10.0 - Wikipedia (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mac_OS_X_10.0&oldid=1086308900)

* Dock — the Dock was a new way of organizing one's Mac OS X applications on a user interface, and a change from the classic method of Application launching in previous Mac OS systems.

* OSFMK 7.3 — the Open Software Foundation Mach kernel from the OSF[5] was part of the XNU kernel for Mac OS X, and was one of the largest changes from a technical standpoint in Mac OS X.

* Terminal — the Terminal was a feature that allowed access to Mac OS X's underpinnings, namely the Unix core. Mac OS had previously had the distinction of being one of the few operating systems with no command line interface at all.[citation needed]

* Mail — email client.

* Address Book

* TextEdit — new on-board word processor, replacement to SimpleText.

* Full preemptive multitasking support, a long-awaited feature on the Mac.

* PDF Support (create PDFs from any application)

* Aqua UI — new user interface

* Built on Darwin, a Unix-like operating system.

* OpenGL

* AppleScript

* Support for Carbon and Cocoa APIs

* Sherlock — desktop and web search engine.

* Protected memory — memory protection so that if an application corrupts its memory, the memory of other applications will not be corrupted.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_X_10.0/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
