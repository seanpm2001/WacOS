It works on these iPads: iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).
- [x] Support for Apple Music Voice Plan Subscription.

### Applications

#### Notes

In the Notes application, users can now apply arbitrary tags to a note (e.g., #cooking, #work); groups of notes with a given tag or tags can be viewed in Smart Folders or a Tag Browser in the sidebar. The new Quick Notes function enables a user to create a note from within any app via system-wide keyboard shortcut or hot corner.

#### Maps

Apple Maps adds a 3D globe, with increased mountain, desert, and forest detail.

### System requirements

macOS Monterey drops support for various Macs released from 2013 to 2015 including all Macs with Nvidia GPUs. Monterey runs on the following Macs:

- [x] MacBook: Early 2016 and newer
- [x] MacBook Air: Early 2015 and newer
- [x] MacBook Pro: Early 2015 and newer
- [x] Mac Mini: Late 2014 and newer
- [x] iMac: Late 2015 and newer
- [x] iMac Pro
- [x] Mac Pro: Late 2013 and newer
- [x] Mac Studio

By using patch tools, macOS Monterey can be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such as the mid-2014 iMac and the 2013 MacBook Pro. Using these methods, it is possible to install macOS Monterey on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook Pro and iMac and 2009 Mac Mini.

### Boot screen

The `Happy Wac` is disabled by default on boot to match the release (starting with Wac OS X 10.2) and on boot, the letter `W` will show. By default, on the first install, it will go with the brand logo (The W logo with no detail) then it will be the `Modern1` logo (The W logo with a metal texture) This can be changed in [`WACOS_12_BOOTCONFIG.cfg`](/12.x/12.0/WACOS_12_BOOTCONFIG.cfg)

### File system

OpenAPFS is now the default file system (starting with WacOS 10.12)

OpenHFS+ 2.0 is still a file system option, along with OpenZFS, which is still in read-only mode.

### Codecs

No new codecs are supported in this release.

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_12/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
