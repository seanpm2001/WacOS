# BOOTCONFIG collection

This directory houses a collection of the official BOOTCONFIG files of WacOS subsystems, along with custom BOOTCONFIG files that are of significance. This area was created out of a need for a centralized location of this data type, and was started with issue [#23](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/23)

Right now, it is empty, and needs a lot of work.
