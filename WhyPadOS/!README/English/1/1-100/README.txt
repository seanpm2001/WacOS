**Predecessor and companion:** [`wOS`](/wOS/)

WhyPadOS is an open source recreation of the iPadOS series of mobile operating systems written in the WacOS style. It is based on iPadOS, a fork of iOS 13 that became its own separate operating system by Apple, exclusively for their iPad line of hardware. Before this, both iPhones, iPods, and iPads ran iOS. After this, only iPhones and iPods ran iOS, while iPads ran iPadOS exclusively. MacOS remained untouched in its domain.
