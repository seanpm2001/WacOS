// For: WacOS/JRE
// About:
// I chose Java as the first project language file for this project (WacOS/JRE) as this project is about supporting the Java programming language through the use of a dedicated runtime environment. The project heavily relies on Java, and thus, Java is the main project language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
